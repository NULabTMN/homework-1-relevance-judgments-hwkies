          DEATII Ef THE DYNAMO.
          THE HANGMAN AND HIS GALLOWS
          RELICS OF BARBARISM.
          Dr. Smilhwick Discourses of a Moro Hu
          mane Agent for tho Infliction of Cap
          ital Punishment Description of Ills
          Deadly Electric Chair.
          Dr. A. P. Southwick, who is a member of
          tho commission to ascertain the most
          humano and practical method known to
          modern science for carrying tho death sen
          tence into effect in capital cases, is an enthu
          siastic investigator, and since tho commis
          sion was created by tho last legislature ho
          has spent considerable time in making re
          searches. "Do you believe in capital punishment,
          doctor?" was asked.
          "I believe tho death penalty is necessary,"
          ho replied, "for there is a class of people, a
          lower order of beings, to whom it is positive
          ly necessary. I refer to peoplo who como
          from a lino of murderers that is, men who
          havo descended directly from families of
          criminal proclivities. Tho man who walks
          around ready to commit a willful, premedi
          tated murder should die. He belongs to a
          race that we want to wipo from tho face of
          the earth. The laws are liberal enough, with
          the various degrees of homicido and man
          slaughter, to protect individuals who do it in
          the heat of passion or under intense provo
          cation." "And about women?"
          "If the law i3 changed from hanging to
          death by electricity then it should and
          would bo made to include women as well as
          men. Any discrimination between the sexes
          would make the law unconstitutional."
          ""Would there b3 any objection to execut
          ing women with electricity.'"
          "No, sir; there would not. I think there
          would no longer be tho samo prejudico that
          thcro is now, because Imaging is a poor way
          of inflicting the death penalty."
          "How would you uso electricity?"
          "Just seo here," said Dr. Southwick,
          jumping up and .seating himself, in an arm
          chair. "Tho condemned man cansifc natur
          ally in a chair like this, placo his liands on
          the metal arms and converse with those
          around him. Tho metal plates would ba
          connected with a powerful d3namo and at
          tho proper moment somebody in another
          room would press a button, closo tho current
          and tho fatal shock would pass through tho
          body of the subject. Tho chargo would go
          straight through tho heart and lungs and
          penetrate the system, death instantly result
          ing. Tho expense of the apparatus with which
          to execute by electricity ia this city would
          bo about $150. Connection cculd bo made
          with the electric light station, and tho ex
          pense of an execution thereafter would bo of
          littlo consequence. It would not cost any
          more than a cigar to kill a condemned man
          after that. It would not bo necessary to
          maintain extensive and powerful machinery
          in nil tho prisons, anil it would bo vastly
          cheaper than hanging."
          "You believe then in electricity?'
          "Electricity Ls tho coming power. Death
          is instantaneous and tho body i not defaced.
          There is not tho morbidness of n hanging,
          which is a relic cf barbarism. Just seo a
          recent execution here Heman's I think it
          was when tho hanged man breathed fifteen
          minutes afteV the drop fell. If that is in
          stantaneous death then I would rather havo
          u lingering death."
          "Have you considered jwisons as a means
          of executing criminals''
          "Prussic acid has been raggested, but
          neither that nor garroting has met with any
          favor. A few havo advocated tho guillotine,
          but I thin!; it is a barbarous mode of causing
          death. Hardly any one favors hanging in
          preference to electricity, tho very system
          being barbarous as are tlio method and
          paraphernalia used.'
          "Do you expect t!:at your plan wul be
          adopted'"
          "I sincerely hope i; w3L If it L adoptdl
          by the coming legislarare otlxr slates will
          undoubted!- adopi it, and I tiisk that
          within two years it will bo adopted all over
          the world- It wooll certainly L-j better
          than obliterating the death penalty, and m
          tho case of a woman there would b; much
          less objection to its operation than there is
          to hanging."
          Dr. Soulhw'ci added that in England the
          eamo quesuon had arisen, but no satisfactory
          substitute for hanging had bsen suggested.
          One of tho commissioners suggested that
          various means bo adopted and the condemned
          culprit 1x3 given his choice of deaths.
          State Senator Daniel II. Meridian has
          written a letter to the commission in which he
          saj-s: "Tho principal objection to the present
          inothod is that it Li primitive in its origin
          and barbarous hi its effects. It lacks every
          element of exactness and precision. It i3
          absolute!' impossible to arrango a formula
          as to the size of tho rope, tho longth of the
          drop or the h"ft of the weight and the dis
          tanco of its fall, as theso sc-vcral elements
          must not only depend upon tho sizo and
          weight but tho general buiid and make up ot
          tho convict. Tho want of exactness in these
          several elements sometimes leads to the muti
          lation of tho bodv by severing the head; to
          unnecessary and sevcro suffering by reason
          of tho breaking of the rop?, nnd also to death
          by sufTocal .en whero there has been an im
          proper aijustment. All these things com
          bine to luako hanging by the neck most
          brutal.
          "I am heartily in favor of the application
          of electricity for tho purposes in question,
          for the reason that it is simple, sure and
          painless. 1 think that if the places of execu
          tion wero limited to two in this state, say
          ono at Auburn and ono at Sing Sing, the
          two stato prisons, and that all convicts as
          Foon as condemned to suffer tho death
          penalty should bo confined in ono of those
          two prisons (depending somewhat upon the
          locality of tho trial), it would be a vast im
          provement upon tho present method of hav
          ing tho criminal confined in the county jail
          till the daj- of execution."
          Regarding tho machinery to Iw used
          Senator llcl.lillan says: "Theso 'executions
          could take place in tho jail proper, in a room
          set apart for that purpose, with no appli
          ances save that of a chair, with tuo nana
          rest of each arm properly connected with
          an electric machine, in which tho condemned
          might bo seated and tho connection made by
          strapping a hand to the hand rest on each
          chair. There can bo no difficulty whatever
          in procuring a current of electricity of suffi
          cient strength to paralyze tho muscles of
          tho heart by this method. Indeed, tho cur
          rent that is used in this city for electric
          lighting purposes is of sufficient strength to
          absolutely dismember the body of nay human
          being, but a current of electricity of suffi
          cient strength to cause instantaneous death
          by passing from hand to hand through the
          heart wi'l not mark the body in tho least."

          APTAN PROPOSED.
          gow Will Electrical Execu
          tions Be Accomplished?
          TlE LAST THING IN KILLING.
          How Various Nations Do Their Criminals
          to Death--New TYok State the Flrat
          commeunty to Adapt the Newest Thing
          in Capital PlUnihment.
          After Jan. 1, 1880, murderers in New York
          sate will depart this life on a streak of light
          ing. Any man who has been sentenced to
          death will go off. so quick that he won't
          know anything about it. The subject of
          putting murderers to death by electricity has
          been agitated in the Empire state for more
          than a year.
          After mature deliberation it was concluded
          that hanging would have to go.
          Hanging has been the fashionable mode of
          punishment for centuries, but a commission
          *appointed by Governor Hill concluded that it
          was too harrowing. They made a number
          of experiments, and finally decided upon
          electricity. A bill was passed by the legis
          lature, but-no provision was made as to the
          way the fluid was to be applied. Finally the
          Medico-legal society took the matter Uo, ap
          pointed a commission, and the result was
          that a particular form of applying the elec
          tricity was suggested. This way of killing
          off the refuse population will probably be
          used in New York state hereafter. Three
          ways of applying the fatal electricity were
          proposed, but none of them answered the
          purpose. One was passing the electri.
          iots city from wrist to
          wrist through the
          body, another
          was passing the
          current from the
          head to one of the
          wrists, the third
          Swas topassthecmu
          rent completely
          t through the prison.
          S1 . etr's body from head
          to foot.
          c c m The objections to
          A CURRENT IN THE BRAIn these methods were
          that the prisoner might have convulsions.
          It was desired, of course, to take the utmost
          care of the prisoner. He was to die as pleas
          antly as possible. Then the attendant under
          this method might make a mistake and be
          struck himself.
          The commission finally concluded that the
          best way would be to have the current pass
          through the hoad from the top to the back of
          the neck. One electrode is fitted to the top
          of the prisoner's head, another placed in con
          tact with the small of his back. The top
          electrode connects with the positive pole, the
          bottom with the negative pole. A leathern
          rest holds the prisoner's head and bands
          keep him from moving. The current, in go
          ing from one electrode to another, does not
          keep in a straight line, but spreads out and
          goes through the entire brain. It resembles
          somewhat a bundle of faggots tied at the two
          ends and swelling out in the middle. The seat
          of consciousness being in the brain, and the
          headquarters for all the nerves being located
          there, it is of course as plain as day that,
          when an electro-motive force of 8, 30 volts
          is applied, the prisoner is bound to die. The
          great beauty of this system is that the pris
          oners don't know it either.
          Heroe we have a villain who is too bad to
          stay around and commit murder any more.
          Step up, ladies and gentlemen, and gazoon
          the wayitisdone. Here we have astouttable
          covered with rubber cloth and having holes
          around its borders for binding. Prisoner,
          come up here and lieon the table. Attendant,
          bind the prisoner to the table. Here is an
          electrode (the negative one) which comes up
          through the table and touches the small of
          the prisoner's back. Here we have a helmet,
          to which the other electrode is joined, and
          t helmet is put on the prisoner's head. The
          Wtrode now touches the top of the prison
          9~head, which has been moistened bywarm
          ater. Prisoner, are you ready? Then, let
          'cgo, Gallagher, and the thing is done. The
          man is as dead as a
          door nail. Another
          modification of this
          method is to let the , /
          prisoner sit in a
          chair. Some pris
          oners will undoubt
          edly prefer to sit
          in a chair, whleilo
          others who were " ".
          born tired will pro- e'O
          for to lie at full
          length. Eerthinug THE DEATH APPARATUS.
          will be done in regard to the com ort of the
          prisoners, and their taste will be consulted
          in every particular.
          This, in brief, is the way the prisoners will
          "lick the bucket" after the 1st of January.
          When Elbridgo T. Gerry, Mathew Hale
          and Alfred P. Southwick wero appointed last
          winter to investigate the matter they took
          the trouble to look up the various methods of
          Panishment in different countries.
          E RLY MODES OF EXECUTION.
          Hanging is a very old institution. The
          earliest form of the gallows was undoubtedly
          a ltout tree and a convenient limb, and they
          seem to have retained their popularity ever
          sinae the hanging of Ai by Joshua, as re
          corded in the Bible.
          Hanging was used and known by the Eng
          lish In the Thirteenth century. They proba
          bly got it front the French. It is recorded
          by a French historian in 1242 that a knight,
          ho had been judicially put to death, was
          hungon the gibbet after the breath had left
          his body. The first use of the primitive gal
          lows seems to have been to exhibit the body
          afler death. The first gibbet used in Eng
          and to expose criminals was in the reign of
          Henry III. The first to be executed by the
          rP was Earl Ferrers, May 5, 1760. After
          is ams had been secured by a black sash
          an a common halter passed around his neck,
          lamonnted a part of the scaffold eighteen
          i.ches above the rest, and the signal being
          given by the sheriff that part of the floor
          ank under him to a level with the rest, and
          be remained with nothing to stand on.
          It seems to be fairly settled that sensation,
          reection and mental horror accompany the
          physicsl tortures of those who are in the act
          tbstangulating. Examples are frequent of
          ao who commit suicide by hanging at
          tmpting to regain their foothold, finding
          te tortures of strangulation greater than
          tbey had conceived . It is reported of a
          Onman, executed in 1160, "that the rope
          ilped her cap partially from her face, and
          ghile hanging at the halter's end, by a
          mighty effort she pu up one of her hands
          ldaiently totdraw it down again over her
          dist0rted features." .

          reader that any one of these methods might
          be improved upon sossiblefar as the phyical com t
          fort of the victi in concerned In countrise
          where these modes of punishment were and
          in some cases are now practiced, the main ob
          ject was to give the prisoner as much soffer
          ing as possible. ie was held up as a terrible
          example. Now, however, the main object in
          to get the prisoner out of the way as soon as
          possible. In order to understand how quick
          a man can die under the force of electricity,
          let us consider first how fast a man can think.
          Well, it takes just one-tenth of a second fora
          nerve to communicate with the brain, ac
          cording to Professor Hemholz Now Pro
          fessor Tyndall estimates that an electric dis
          charge occurs in one hundred thousandth of
          a second, or ten thousand times more rapidly
          than nerve transmission. So you see that it
          it were possible a man would die by the
          process described ten thousand times before
          his nerves would have time to communicate
          with his brain.
          Last winter, for the purpose of ascertain
          ing the effect of the electric light current on
          the action of the heart, the thorax of a
          chloroformed dog caught in Buffalo was
          opened, so that the lungs and heart could be
          seen in action by forcing respiration as in
          conscious life. At the instant when the cur
          rent passed through the heart it became a
          mass of quivering flesh. It was noticed that
          an attempt to breathe was made after the
          current was passed through the dog. This
          indicated that the brain had not lost its sus
          ceptibility to impressions, and shows that in
          execution the current should be passed
          through the center. It should not be for
          gotten, however, that the dog was from
          utffalo. The commission couldheaveselected
          no tougher subject than a Buffalo dog.
          There can be no question, however, that
          electricity is the thing to do the business.

          HOW KEMMLER DIED.
          "Electrocution" Not Wholly

          An Apnalllnef Scene When the Victim
          Began to Return to Con
          sciousness After the
          First Shock.
          Auburn, N. V., Aug. 6.—The trial
          of a new means of taking htfman life,
          while prompted by humane motives,
          has resulted in a sickening spectacle
          presented by a pinioned wretch, at
          whose vital center was kept pounding
          for some moments an alternating cur
          rent of electricity which, though it ul
          timately destroyed hia life, subjected
          the criminal to a torture of whioh no
          living being has knowledge, and which
          none can describe. Im perfect registry
          of the current pressure or faulty con
          tact of the electrodes prevented in
          stantaneous death. The reader may
          gain some conception of the process of
          this killing when the statement is
          made that the person whose body
          3hould be shaken into fragments could
          not have suffered suoh pain as did
          Kemmler, whose nerve cells and tis
          sues were disintegrated not in a flash,
          as designed, but by the relatively slow
          strokes of the electric hammers upon
          them. Whether the blood yet retains
          its normal consistency or whether it is
          partially or wholly fluidized by the di
          vorce of oxygen from the blood cor
          puscles, can only be determined by
          the 6utopsy.
          The Execution Room.
          WONDERFUL NERVE.
          Kemmler's nerve was something
          wonderful. He never faltered. He
          directed the adjustment of himself in
          the chair and counseled the warden to
          moderation to secure perfect safety.
          The shock was given at 0:43%, acd
          was continued about 18 seconds. Two
          minutes after the current was cut off
          there was evidence of respiration. As
          soon as possible the current waß re
          turned and then cutoff. Again respir
          ation was evident, after a f;w mo
          ments. Saliva came from the mouth;
          the chest heaved; there was wheezing
          in tbe throat. The shock was again
          put to tbe prisoner, who, the doctors
          remarked, was unconscious from tbe
          moment of the first shook. After a
          short time smoke appeared at tbe
          base; bis
          FLESH WAS BURNING.;
          Tne spectacle was most trying. The
          man, the doctors said, suffered no
          pain, however. The warden says the
          voltage at first shock was 1800 volts,
          which run down to a point not named.
          After a third contact of four minutes
          tbe man was declared dead. The
          warden's certificate ot death was (hen
          signed by all present and the party
          broke up at 7:30 to meet at B:ls,when
          the body would be ready for the au
          topsy.
          When the mask was taken off tbe
          face the eyes were found half open,
          and his expression, while not normal
          or placid, was not horrifying.
          TAKING TUB CHAIR —KEMMLER MAKES
          ASPEECH
          Warden Durston stood at the left of
          the chair with a band on the back of
          it. Almost at the moment Kemmler
          took his seat he began to speak in
          quick, short jcrioda. "Now, gentle
          men," he said,"this is William Kemm
          ler. I have warned bim he has got to
          die, and if he has anything to say he
          will say it." As the warden finished,
          Kemmler looked up, and in a high
          vo:ce ( without any hesitation, and as
          though he bad prepared himself with
          the speech: ''Well, I wish every one
          good luck in this world, and I think I
          am going to the good place. The pa
          pers have been raying lots of stuff
          that isn't so. That's all I have to
          •ay."
          LOS ANGELES HERALD.
          With the conclusion of the speeoh
          he turned his back on the jury,took off
          bis coat and handed it to the warden.
          This disclosed the fact that a bole bad
          been cut from the bam! of the trousers
          dowD, so aa to expose tbe base of tbe
          spine. When the coat was off Kemm
          ler turned in the direction of the door
          through which he came into the room,
          and began to unbutton hia vest; at
          the same time the warden drawing the
          interfering drapery of his shirt through
          the hole in his pants arid cutting it off,
          so as to leave a little surface of the
          flesh against which one of the elec
          trodes was to press, absolutely bare.
          Warden Dustoa called attention to the
          fact that it waa not necessary to re
          move the vest, and Kemmler calmly
          buttoning it again, carefully arranged
          his necktie.
          "Dju't hurry Bbout this matter,"
          said the warden; be perfectly cool."
          He was perfectly coo!—by ail cdds tbe
          coolest man in the room.
          BUFFERED NO PAIN.
          Auburn, N. V., Aug. 6.—After
          there remained no dcubt that the cur
          rent bad done its fatal work, Dr. Fell,
          said, "Well, there's no doubt about
          one thing; tbe man never suffered an
          iota of pain." In after consultations
          other physicians expressed the same
          belief. It was some mitigation cf tbe
          horrors of the situation to believe
          this.
          Some doctors disagreed with this
          view, and doubted his death when his
          cheat moved and sounds issued from
          his lips.
          THE AUTOPSY.
          The autopßy began at 9 o'clock. It
          was found when the body waa spread
          out on the table that very severe rigor
          raortia had set in. There was little
          relaxation, and it was with difficulty
          that the corpse was straightened out.
          On examination it was found the sec
          ond electrode burned through the skin
          and into the flesh at the base of the
          spire, making a scar nearly five inch
          es iv diameter. The heart, lunga and
          other organs were t-ken out and
          found in good healthy condition, and
          will be preserved for future examina
          tion. Toe brain a!ao was taken out.
          It, too, will be examined.
          ANOTHER ACCOUNT.
          Details of the Executlon-A Slcken-
          Scene.
          Auburn (N. V.) Aug. 6—[By the
          Associated Press.] —Kemmler sat
          down in the electric chair as qui
          etly as though he was sitting down to
          dinner. Warden Durston stood ou
          the right and George Vieling, of Al
          bany, ou the left. They began immed
          iately to adjust the straps, the con
          demned holding up his arms so as to
          give them every assistance. When the
          straps had been adjusted about the
          body the arms were fastened down and
          then the warden leaned over aud
          parted Kemmler's feet so as to bring
          the legs near the legs of the chair.
          While the straps were being arranged,
          Kemmler said: "Take your time.
          Don't be in a hurry. Be sure every
          thing is all right." Two or three times
          he repeated these words. Warden
          Durston reassuerd him with the ro-
          Fatal Cap.
          mark that it would not hurt him; that
          he (Durston) would be with him all
          through, but it was not fear that
          Kemmler felt, it was rather a certain
          pride in the exaotness of the experi
          ment. He seemed to have greater int
          erest in its success than those who had
          made preparations for it, who were
          watching its progress, and its final fa
          tal conclusion.
          When tho strap had been
          adjusted the warden placed his band on
          Kemmler's head aud held it against the
          rubber cushion which ran over the back
          of the chair. Kemmler's eyes were
          turned to the other side of the room.
          Before, they had followed the warden
          in his movement about. Then the doom
          ed mau made a fewremarks in a perfet
          -1; clear, composed tone of voice: "Well
          good luck" was one of them, and,
          "Durston, see that things are all right"
          was another, Vieling unfastened the
          THURSDAY MORNING, AUGUST 7, 1890.
          thumbscrew which held back tbe chair
          in place and began to lower it so that
          the rubber cap which had the saturated
          sponge pressed againat the top of
          Kemmler's head.
          THE DOOMED MAN'S NEKVE.
          The warden assisted in holding
          Kemmler's head. Kemmler said, "Oh,
          you had better press tbat down, part
          ner, I guess; press that down." So the
          head piece was undamped and pressed
          further down. While it was beiDg
          done Kemmler said, "Well, I want to
          do the best I can; I can't do any better
          than that."
          Warden Durston took in his hand
          the leather harness which was to
          be adjusted to Kemmler's head.
          It was a muzzle of broad leather
          straps, which went across the fore
          houd and chin. The top of the
          strap pressed down against the
          nose of Kemmler until it flattened it
          down slightly over his face. Tho har
          ness was put in place, Dr. Spitzka who
          was atanding near the chair, aaid: God
          bless you, Kemler,' and the condemned
          man answered, "Thank you." Soft-
          *
          Death Chair.
          ly the door leading into the room where
          the switches were arranged was partly i
          opened and a man stood in the door
          way. Beyond him there were two other
          men. Which one of them was to touch !
          the lever and make the connection with '
          the chair was not known.. Warden
          Durston said it never will be known. !
          The dynamo in the machineshop was
          running at good speed aud the voltme
          ter on the wall showed a little more J
          than 1000 volts. The warden turned to i
          the assembled doctors and those im- ■
          mediately around the execution chair
          and said: "Do the doctors say it is all !
          right?'' Hardly a minute bad elapsed
          since the adjustment of tbe straps.
          There was no time for Kemmler to have 1
          weakened then, if his marvelous cour- 1
          age had not been equal to the test of j
          further delay, but there was no fear
          that he would lose couraSe. He was as
          firm in the chair aa before be entered !
          the room.
          THE FIRST SnOCK.
          At the warden's request Dr. Fell
          stepped forward with a long syringe
          in his hand and deftly wetted two
          sponges which were at the electrodes,
          one on top ol the head and the other at
          the base of the spine. Tho water
          which he put on them was impregnated
          with salt. Dr. Spitzra answered the
          warden's question with a shout of "All
          right" which was echoed by others
          about him. "Heady?" said Durston
          again aud then "Good bye." He
          stepped to tiie door and through the
          opening said to some one in the next
          room, but to whom will probably never
          be known with certainty, "Everything
          is ready." There was an almost im
          mediate response and at HAS the elec
          tric current was turned on.
          There was a sudden oouvulsion of the
          frame iv tbe chair. A spasm went
          over Kemmler from head to foot. He
          was confined by straps and springs
          that held him so firmly that no limb or
          other part of the body stirred more
          than a small fraction of an inch
          from its resting place. The twitching
          tbat the muscles of the face underwent
          gave it for a moment an expression
          of pain, but no cry escaped from the
          lips; which were free to move at will,
          no sound came forth to suggest tbat
          consciousness lasted more than tbe
          infinitisimal fraction of a second—be
          yond the calculation of human mind.
          The body remained in a riged position
          for seventeen seconds. The jury and
          witnessses who remained seated up to
          this moment came hurriedly forward
          and surrounded the chair. There was
          no movement of the body beyond the
          first convulsion. It was not a pretty
          sight, the man in his shirt sleeves
          bound hand and foot, body and even
          head, with the heavy' frame work
          pressing down on top of the skull.
          Dr. McDonald held a stop watch in
          his hand and as the seconds flew by be,
          noted their passage. Spitzka looked
          at the stop watch and as the tenth
          second expired he cried out "Stop!"
          other voices cried "Stop." The ward
          en turned to the doorway, called out
          "Stop" to the man at the lever. A
          quick movement of the arm and the
          electric current was switched off.
          There was a relaxation of the body in
          the chair. "He's dead," said Spitzka
          calmly.
          COMING BACK TO LIFE.
          Dr. Balch was leaning over the body
          looking at the exposed skin, Sudden
          ly he cried out sharply "Dr. McDon
          ald, see that rupture." In a moment
          Drs. Spitzka and McDonald had leant
          over and were looking where Balch was
          pointing at a little red spot ou the
          hand that rested on the right arm of
          tbe chair. The index finger of the
          hand had curved baokward as the
          muscles contracted and soraped a
          small hole in the skin at the base of
          the thumb on the back of the hand.
          There was nothing strange in this
          alone, but the little rupture was drip
          ping blood.
          "Turn the current on instantly.
          The man is not dead," cried Spitzka.
          Faces grew white and forms fell back
          from the chair. The warden sprang to
          the doorway and cried "Turn on the
          current." But the current could not
          be turned on. When the signal to
          stop had come, the operator had
          pressed the little button which gave
          the sign to the engineer to stop
          the dynamo. The dynamo was
          almost at a standstill and the
          volt metre registered an almost
          imperceptible current. The opera
          tor sprang to the button and
          gave a sharp quick signal. There
          was rapid response, but it was not
          quick enough to anticipate tho signs
          of reviving consciousness. As the group
          or horror-stricken witnesses stood help
          lessly by, all eyes were fixed on the
          chair. Kemmler's lips began to drip
          spittle and in a moment the chest be
          gun to move and from the mouth came
          heavy stertorous sounds, quickened
          and increasing with respiration. There
          was no voice but that of the warden
          crying to the operator to turn ou the
          current, and tbe wheezing sound, a
          half groan, which forced itself past the
          tightly closed lips, sounded through the
          still chamber with ghastly distinctness.
          Some of the witnesses turned away
          from the sight.
          ONE . FAINTED.
          Tho scene seemed a long time in
          reaching the climax. In reality there
          were but 73 seconds in the inter
          val which elapsed between the mo
          ment when the first sound issued
          from Kemmler's lips until the response
          to the sienal came from the dynamo
          room, it came with the same sudden
          ness that marked tbe first shock which
          passed through Kemmler's body. The
          sound which horrified the listeners
          about the chair was cut off sharply as
          the body once more became rigid. The
          slimy ooze still dropped from the mouth
          aud ran slowly down the beard and on to
          the gray vest. Twice wero there
          wrenches of the body as the electri- I
          cians in the next room threw the cur- j
          rent on and off. There was no mistake I
          this time about the killing. The dyna
          mo was run up to the highest speed,
          and again the full current of 2000 volts
          was sent through the body. How long
          this was kept in action no one knows.
          To the excited group about tho chair it
          seemed an interminable time. Dr.
          Daniel, who thought he had an approx
          imate idea of the time at least, said it
          was four and a half minutes in all.
          The warden's assistant who stood over
          the dynamo, said on the record signal
          the machinery was run only three aud
          a half minuted all together.
          No one was anxious to give the
          signal to stop. AH dreaded the re
          sponsibility of offering, to the man a
          chance to revive or give again at least
          those appearances of returning anima
          tion which startled and sickened the
          witnesses a few minutes before. As
          the anxious group stood silently
          watching the body, suddenly there I
          rose from it
          A WniTE VAPOR
          Bearing with it the pungent and sick
          ening odor of a body burning. Again
          there were cries to stop the current and
          again the warden sprang to the door
          and gave a quick order to his assistan.
          The current was stopped and again
          there was a relaxation of the body.
          Xo doubt this time the current had
          done its work, if not well at least com
          pletely. Dr. Fell who stood by the
          side of the special correspondent of
          the Associated Press, turned and said:
          "Well, there is no doubt about one
          thing, the mau never suffered untold
          of pain." In atter consultations other
          physicians expressed the same belief.
          It was some mitigation of the horrors
          of the situation to learn this,
          butthe mitigation wa3 extremely slight
          when it developed at another point
          that some doctors disagreed very
          materially.
          DOCTORS AT VARIANCE.
          Was Kemmler dead when the chest
          moved and the lips gave forth those
          strange ghastly sounds? Was be
          breathing or was there an involuntary
          and phenomenal movement of the chest
          muscles? Some of the eminent experts
          in attendance said to an Associated
          Press correspondent while the body
          was still warm in.tho chair that there
          was no doubt these were signs of
          returning animation; that respiiation.
          for respiration they believed it to be,
          was growing stronger, and tbat in time
          if the current tjad not been turned on
          again he would have revived. Others,
          among them Dr. Spitzka, stated with
          equal positiveness of couviction that
          the first shock killed Kemmler instantly.
          Doctors Daniels and Southwick, the
          fathers of electrocide, believe that
          Kemmler was dead, but they think the
          current should have been continued
          longer than 17 seconds, which was the
          official time of the first contact. There
          is no way in which a positive deter
          mination of tbe question can be made.
          It will always remain unsolved.
          OTHER DETAILS.
          something Wrong with the Machln-
          ory—A Bungling Job.
          Auburn, New York, Aug. 6.—As
          sociated Press.]. Kemmler bad gone
          peacefully to sleep in tbe night and
          had slept soundly and was snoring still
          at 5 o'clock when he was awakened by
          one of his guards. Pastor Houghton,
          who attended Kemmler and Prison
          Chaplain Yates were with him. They
          read to him troin tbe Bible and be
          prayed with them. He dressed himself
          without aid in a suit of gray mixed
          goods. His hair he combed and brushed
          with great care. His shoes were well
          polished aud while be made himself
          finally tidy the warden and a tall
          stranger, who is a deputy marshal in
          Buffalo, entered the cell. The warden
          explained to Kemmler that be must
          have the top of bis head shaved. The
          prisoner demurred. He had taken
          great pains in dressing bis hair and
          beside, as he explained to the warden,
          be did not want to be disfigured.
          Kemmler's hair is a dark brown and
          wavy with a hyperion curl that fell on
          his forehead, Of this he was proud.
          In the shadow of death his vanity
          asserted itself. His hair how
          ever, was cut, but tbe curl
          was saved and, as the sequel proved,
          with no good results. The shaven spot
          was 2i by U inches in size, and was
          not really shaven but was cropped
          fairly close.
          While this was proceeding the wit
          nesses examined the chair. The death
          belt was run by the dynamo, and the
          incandescent test lamps in the ante
          chamber glowed faintly. " How feebly
          they burn," exclaimed Dr. Mac Do
          nald, who was the only one who got into
          the ante-room, and that while ignorant
          of the warden's desire to keep its se
          crets inviolate. In response to Dr.
          Mac Donald's comment, Electrician
          Davis remarked that there was "some
          thing wrong about the machinery
          down there," referring to the dynamo
          end of the circuit. This remark took
          place before the electricizing. It is
          well to remember, and was undoubt
          edly as true a few minutes lator when
          the bolt was applied to Kemmler.
          The condemned man, after having
          his hair cut on top his head listened to
          the readiug of tho warrant by the
          warden. When the current waa
          first turned on tho least unhappy
          of all in the room was Dr. Southwick of
          Buffalo, the father of electricizing in
          capital cases and who has been study
          ing and been working upon the sub
          ject since 1881. "There," he exclaimed,
          as he strode away from the chair to the
          knot of witnesses at the other end of
          the room, "there is the culmination of
          ten years work and study. We live in
          a higher civilization from this day.
          But even while he spoke a quick sharp
          cry went up from those yet closely
          watching about the silent figure in the
          chair. There had been a movement in
          the breast of the man whom all had
          believed had died one minute and 47
          seconds before. The harrowing scenes
          attending the second electrocution fol
          lowed.
          The doctors in general declared that
          the man from the very first contact was
          beyond consciousness and some
          thought that the action which
          startled all and sent the war
          den away with a white face
          to order the current renewed, was
          ouly reflex muscular action. Not so
          ono physician, who declared that he
          would stake his name that he would
          bring Kemmler back to consciousness
          and life with brandy and bypodormics.
          Meantime one of the witnesses, Mr. G.
          G. Bain of Washington, D. C, had
          fainted and lay upon the bench where
          he was being fanned.
          When finally tbe electric mask was
          removed Kemmler's eyes were found
          to be half closed and without tho
          glassy stare common to eyes in death.
          The lids were lifted and tests of the
          pupils with bright light were made.
          There was no contraction of the pupils.
          Where the mask had pressed the fore
          head there was a livid mark, the mark
          of the law's righteous desecration.
          The nose and region of its base was a
          deeply livid hue. Purple spots soon be
          gan mottling the hands, arms and
          nock, and the doctors said he was
          surely dead. Oue of the Buffalo doc
          tors seven minutes after the straps
          were removed cut the skin at the tem
          ple for a microscopic specimen
          of the dead man's blood. 'It was
          immediately examined - and found
          slightly coagulated. On the electrodes
          being withdrawn from contact with the
          body, hair adhered to the rim of the
          upper disc. Drs. McDonald and
          Shrady examined the head. They
          found there waa a deep circular imprint
          on the top of the head made by the
          Stlllflll SALE

          sharp pressure of the electrode''s rim.
          The spot where a tuft of Kemmler''s
          hair had been cut off just before death
          was found to constitute not more than
          one-third of the area of contact with
          the electrode and close examinatien
          disclosed tbat the edges of copper
          within tueeloctrode had slightly burned
          the scalp just where the head bad been
          cut. Had not Kemmler''s desire to
          avoid disfigurement by the cutting off
          of bis hair prevailed, contact would
          have been more perfect aud ths
          chances ot instaneous death would
          have been very much greater,
          and possibly the disfigurement
          which he dreaded would have been
          avoided. Aa to the causes of the fail
          ure to kill Kemmler instantly, there is
          said by all physicians to be no doubt
          that consciousness was stricken from
          the brain instantly. Tlie fact that he
          waa not instantly killed is the result of
          improper contact or insufficient voltage
          or pressure.
          Warden Durston says 1700 volt 3 were
          first applied to Kemmler. When ques
          tioned tonight by an Associated Press
          correspondent if the 20 incandescent
          lamps on the circuit were burning
          when the bolt was discharged into the
          murderer, he stated that they were.
          They should not have been. The mo
          ment before switching the current into
          Kemmler the teat lamps should have
          been cut off. Each lamp consumes 50
          volts, hence 20 took 1000 volts at once
          out of the current sent to Kemmler.
          That left 700 volts to cause death. The
          best authorities state that lo per oent.
          of a current is stopped at tne points of
          contact, and that 85 is thua expended
          in the body. Eighty-five per cent.of the
          700 volts not consumed today by the
          test lamps is 590 volts of measure. This
          is not enough to surely kill instantly
          with good contact and that of today
          was not perfect. The warden says all
          was working right this morning,though
          last night at midnight his appliances
          were in such order that he was not
          certain whether the execution would
          take place today, even though be had
          summoned hia guests to the prison at
          an early hour this morning. Warden
          Durston has been througu a terrific
          ordeal, and the knavery of men has
          been pressed upon him so much where
          he least expected, that he scarcely
          knowa whether to trust himself. We
          will approach the eletricizing of Fish
          here with more light.
          The concensus of opinion among
          witnesses here today is that there is
          not the slightest doubt that a human
          being may be instantly killed by 1000
          volts applied through a perfect contact
          and continued 20 seconds.
          The body of Kemmler will doubtless
          be disposed, of tomorrow in the prison
          burying ground with quick lime to
          hasten dissolution.

          NO WORD
          With Brute Courage Czolgosz Met De
          -th
          In the Electric Chair.
          Cowardice Quivered on His Lips, But Unsustained by Prayer or Hope of Eter
          nity He Felt the Mask of Death Upon His Face and Passed to Oblivion,
          Hated and Despised.
          Auburn, N. Y., Oct 20.-(Spl.)-Loon
          F. Czolgosz, alias Fred Nieman, was
          successfully electrocuted at Auburn
          prison this morning. He was pro
          nouncod dead at 7:10:15 a. in.
          With the purely animal courage that
          bud sustained blm and the Innate cow
          ard within him struggling to his lips,
          the youthful murderer, hated by tho
          nation and tho world at largo, paid the
          ponalty for his crime.
          Ho took tho chair at 7:15 and In less
          itlmo than It takes to tell it, tho deadly
          current had paaHod through his body,
          rubblnrr 'nmfeshla miserable existence
          . with merciful and unerring swiftness.
          Seated In tho chair, with the fatal
          curroilt about to bo applied, Czolgosz,
          V facing tho witnesses said;
          "I shot the President becauso 1
          thought It would benefit good work
          ing people by ridding them of abom
          inations. I am not sorry for my
          crime."
          During Oils time tho attendants wcro
          busy strapping him to tho enalr. His
          last words were: "I am heartily sorry
          I did not see my father."
          This was said after tho strap had
          been drawn across his face, yet his
          words were heard distinctly by all tho
          witnesses in tho roomi Ho went to
          his death unsupported by tho com
          forting thought that ho had mado
          pence with his God.
          For Uie (lrst time In the history of
          the prison a condemned man marched
          to tlie fatal chair unaccorupnnicd by a
          Spiritual advisor, Spiritual aid hod
          been offered hUn, but ho scorned all
          entreaties. Ho wanted no one to prny
          tpt his soiuV
          Crolgosz wns awakened from a
          sound sleep at tliflO nnd tho death wnr
          iant read. He listened without emo
          tion and after eating spailngly of
          brcnkfa&t, prepared for tho deatll
          chain Ho caino In without a tremor,
          and took his plnce, saying nothing be
          yond tho remarks quoted.
          Last evening, Crolgosa reluctantly
          recelred Fathers ' Fudzluskl and
          Hlckey. It was late and ho had ouce
          refused to meet them. When Uioy
          reached tho prleott Supt Collins con
          voyed their request for nu Intervlow
          to Uie prisoner. Czolgosz Bvjnt back
          word that ho did not cwo to seo them,
          but tho priests asked to bo allowed to
          go to him desplto his rofusal.
          Supt Collins consented, and person
          ally escorted them to tho cell. I The
          priests remained with Czolgosz for
          three-quarters of an hour, and earnest
          ly pleaded with the prisoner to repeut
          and pray for divine forgiveness. He
          rejected all their advances, however,
          and they regretfully withdrew. They
          told the prisoner they would hold
          themselves ready to answer a call
          from him at any hour of tho night
          It was 7 o'clock when Supt Collins
          went Into the death house and tried
          to get the prisoner to talk to him.
          Although he rreinaincd In the cell some
          time he was apparently not success
          ful In getting anything material from
          him.
          At 8 o'clock a brother and brother-in-law
          arrived, and Supt Collins took
          them down to the condemned man's
          cell. There was no demonstration
          when they met Czolgosz merely
          stepped to th0 front of bla stool cage
          and said: "Hello." The brother ven
          turcd tho remarks: "I wish you would
          tell us. Leon, who got you Info this
          scrape."
          The ossasin answered In a slow, hes
          itating manner, "No one; nobody had
          anything to do with It but me."
          "That Is not how you were brought
          up," said the brother, "and you ought
          to toll us everything now."
          "I haven't got anything to toll," ho
          answered In a surly manner.
          "Do you want to see tho priests
          ngain?" asked his brother, And ho on.
          swered with moro vehemenco than ho
          had previously shown:
          "No, them, don't send them hero
          again; I don't want thorn."
          Tho brothor-ln-law interjected here:
          "That's right, Leon." Tho brother
          looked rather disturbed by tho 'answer.
          Then stepping up close to the bars,
          the condemned man said: ' ;
          "And don't you have any praying
          over ino when I'm dead. I don't want
          It I dou't want any of their re
          ligion." There was a painful pause of a few
          minutes and then the relatives resum
          ed casual conversation with him, to
          which ho replied In monosyllables, ;m
          til the bi other-in-law suggested, much
          to Supt. Colllus' emprise, that ho and
          the bi other be peimltted to witness
          the execution. Before Supt Collins
          could reply Leon Czolgosz said:
          "Yes, Mr. Superintendent lot them
          seo me killed."
          Supt. Colllus told tho trio In emphat
          ic tonus that no such thing could bo
          allowed and oideied them to say good
          by. Czolgosz walked to the back of bis
          coll, sat down on the edge of his cot
          nnd did not answer the last farewell.
          When the relatives arrived ut the
          warden's office they ugnlii renowed
          thou- request to see the execution, to
          which Mr. Colons replied: "Emphat
          ically no. Czplgosz will be killed at
          7 o'clock tomorrow and If you apply
          to tho warden in the afternoon you
          may bo ablo to seo tho body."
          Tho two men were then lot out of the
          prison.

          Twenty-two
          jears ago this week, on August C,
          1890, William Kemmlcr, a condemned
          murderer, was put to death In the
          electric chair In Auburn prison. Kern.
          mler ttas the first victim to be legal
          ly executed by electricity in tb Unit
          ed States and his case was the sub
          ject of wide discussion at the time.
          The action of New York In substitut
          ing the electric chair for the gallows
          has been found generally satisfact
          ory and her example has been fol
          lowed by Ohio, Virginia, South Caro
          lina, Massachusetts, Kentucky auJ
          New Jersey.
          ijlnce the execution of Kemmler
          there hae been 151 persona put to
          death In the electric chair In New
          York. The state prison authorities
          estimate that It costs about J4000 per
          individual to carry, out the capital
          punishment mandate. On the basis
          of Oils estimate New York state haa
          expended about JC3.000 for electro
          cutions since that form of Inflicting
          the death penalty was introduced.
          Several times the electric chair at
          Sing Sing has had two victims in
          one day, and on one occasion a short
          time ago three persons were put to
          death within a period of twenty-four
          hours. Rut never before has there
          been such a wholesale execution of
          death sentences Imposed on prison
          ers In this state as is scheduled to
          take place at Sing Sing next week.
          Nino men are to die on the same
          day, and In as rapid succession H3
          they can be led to the death chair.
          -:ix of the nine prospective victims
          are the Italians who were convicted
          of the atrocious murder of Mrs Mary
          Hall at Croton Id Kit. Westchester
          County, on Nov 9, 1911.

          BECKER IS EXECUTED
          WITH PRAYER ON LIPS
          (Continued From Page 1.)
          The one time police officer hesitated
          as he entered the execution room. It
          seemed to the witnesses as if he was
          startled that the death chair was so
          near at hand. He looked quickly at
          the double row of witnesses, glanced
          at the floor, swept with his eyes the
          whitened walls of the room and then,
          suddenly, as if coming to himself,
          walked briskly over the rubber mat
          and seated himself in the electric
          chair. Behind Becker followed the
          prison priests chanting the prayer of
          death, which was repeated by the con
          demned man.
          "Jesus, ijtfary, Joseph, hkve mercy on
          my soul," nervously spoke Becker as
          deputy wardens stepped forward and
          adjusted the electrodes. Hardly a
          minhte elapsed before the electrode
          was applied to the right leg, a slit
          having been previously cut in the
          trouser leg from the knee down. After
          the electrode had been firmly adjusted
          against a shaven spot on the back of
          the condemned man's head, the state
          executioner looked at Deputy Warden
          Johnson, who surveyed the figure that
          was ctlll mumbling the death prayer
          in the chair. Johnson half turned his
          head and the executioner jammed the
          switch.
          Three Shocks Given.
          The first shock lasted a full minute
          and the executioner said that it was
          1,850 volts and ten aniperes in
          strength. It came while Becker was
          still commending his soul to his
          niflknr.
          I The two prison physicians stepped
          forward to examine the collapsed flg
          ure that sat supported in the death
          chair by the thick black leather straps.
          The stethoscope was applied to the
          heart and Dr. Charles Farr, the prison
          physician, pressed his finger against
          the artery in the neck. There was
          still a feeble fluttering of the heart.'
          The physician stepped back from
          the rubber mat and again the electric
          current pulsed through the body. The
          shock lasted seven seconds and the
          current was then turned off. After 4
          hasty examination Dr. Farr asked that
          a third shock be given. This lasted
          nve seconds. An examination that
          took several minutes followed. Three
          physicians among the witnesses then
          made an examination and Dr.- Farr at
          5:55 o'clock proriounced Becker dead.
          Writes Last Statement.
          During the night Becker penciled on
          a piece of paper what he captioned
          "My Dying Declaration." It was tak
          en to the warden's office where two
          copies were typewritten, which Becker
          signed with his fountain pen in a bold
          hand To Deputy Warden Johnson,
          who bad charge of the execution in
          place of Warden Thomas Mott Os
          borne, who does not believe in the
          death penalty, the one time police
          lieutenant gave his fountain pen as a
          gift. "It is the last thing that I have
          to give away and I want you to have
          it. I want you to give this statement
          to the newspaper men."
          Becker's message given out just be
          fore he went to his death read:
          "Gentlemen: I stand before you in
          my full senses, knowing that no power
          on -iarth can save me from the grave
          that la to receive me. In the face of
          that, in the teeth of those who con
          demned me, and in the presence of my
          God and your God I proclaim my ab
          solute innocence of the foul crime for

          of the innocent! May'Almighty God
          pardon everyone who has contributed
          In any degree to my untimely death.
          And now on the brink of my grave I
          declare to the world that I am proud
          to have been the husband of the pur

          (Signed) "Charles Becker."
          Talks All Night.
          After his wife had said farewell,
          shortly after midnight, Becker main
          tained a casual conversation with
          Deputy Warden Johnson who sat be
          side tne screen in front of his cell.
          Sometimes he smoked cigars, after
          jwhich he would let his head fall on
          I his hand and gaze reflectively at the
          I floor for minutes at a time. Dawn
          found him seated on the edge of his
          cot carefully pinning a photograph of
          his wife on his white shirt just over
          his heart. Then, as if he desired to
          have her all to himself, Becker put on
          a thin black alpaca coat, which he
          tightly buttoned. The photograph was
          not seen by the witnesses until the
          prison" physician opened his coat as he
          sat in the death chair.
          Becker was put to death by the state
          executioner whose name is unknown
          to the public. This man succeeded
          State Electrician Davis and he said he
          would not take the job unless his name
          wis kept secret. He lives in a little
          town up-state and went about his
          work briskly.
          Becker's executioner said that in his
          opinion the man had died instantly at
          the first contact.
          Negro Follows Becker.
          An autopsy on the body of Becker
          was performed, according to law, im
          mediately after the execution. After
          Becker's body had been removed from
          the electric chair, Samuel Haynes, a
          nefgro murderer, was brought into the
          execution room and electrocuted. One
          of Becker's last requests to Warden
          Osborne was that''he be put to death
          before Haynes.
          Mrs. Becker Makes Statement.
          A statement credited to Mrs. Becker
          was given out here shortly after her
          husband's death.
          "I shall never rest," she was quoted
          as aaying, "until I have exposed the
          metl ods which were used to convict
          my husband. Whether he was guilty
          or innocent, there was no justification
          for the means employed to convict
          him.

          TWO ELECTROCUTED
          IN KENTUCKY JAIL
          Eddyville, Ky., July 30—For the
          third time in the history of Kentucky
          a double electrocution took place this
          morning at 3:30 o'clock at the Eddy
          ville penintiary.
          The firBt to be executed was Turn

          victed for the killing of R. J. Mc
          Murtry, sheriff of Hardin county. The
          second was William Lane, 25, a negro,
          convicted at Pineville, on a charge of
          killing his wife. Lane was the first
          negro to be executed in Kentucky

          a means of inflicting the death pen

          haps that Is why I loved him so."
          History of Case.
          Herman Rosenthal, the gambler for
          whose murder Charles Becker was sen
          tenced to die in the electric chair, was
          shot to death by hired gunmen in the
          early morning of July 16, 1912, in front
          of the Hotel Metropole on Forty-third
          street, a few stepB from Broadway.
          The murder was' the swift culmination
          of sensational charges made a few
          days before by Rosenthal against Beck
          er in which Rosenthal asserted that
          Becker, then head of the strong arm
          squad of detectives, freely sold police
          protection and had accumulated thou
          sands of dollars of graft money.
          Rosenthal went further than that.
          He stfore that Becker was his silent
          partner in a gambling enterprise that
          failed and that Becker, angered by
          losses where he had expected large
          profits, raided the Rosenthal estab
          lishment and drove Rosenthal out of
          business by stationing uniformed po
          licemen on his premises day and night.
          These charges were published and
          District Attorney Whitman began an
          investigation of them. He summoned
          Rosenthal to the criminal courts build
          ing and listened to ljis story. An ap
          pointment was made with Rosenthal
          for the next day. Before the time
          came, .Rosenthal was murdered.
          When the assassins haid done their
          work, they ran across the street, jump
          ed into a grey automobile which was
          waiting at the. curb and whirled away
          uptown. A bystander caught the
          license number of the car.
          Murder Car Found.
          District Attorney Whitman notified
          by telephone of the murder, reached
          the police station where Rosenthal's
          body lay before. da:wn. He aroused
          his detectives from their sleep and
          spread a dragnet over the city for the
          murder car. It was found before night.
          Its driver, Louis Shapiro, and Louis
          Libbay, part owner, were arrested and
          Mr. Whitman asserted openly in an
          emphatic statement that the police
          had abetted the murder.
          New York City, already interested
          in the charges of police corruption,
          responded to the news of the murder
          as if to a call to arms. Becker, who
          had been the chief target of Rosen
          thal's accusations, was openly sus
          pected. He was relieved of his com
          mand of the strong arm squad and
          transferred to the Bronx. Jack Rose,
          his graft collector, walked Into the
          crimmal courts building the day after
          the murder and surrendered to the district attorney, declaring he had
          nothing to fear. Harry Vallo and
          Bridgle Webber, gamblers and friends
          of Rose and Becker, were arrested aa
          witnesses. The grand jury began its
          investigation.
          Rose Turns Informer.
          Rose lay in prison twelve days with
          out word from Becker, and, believing
          his chief had deserted him, confessed.
          Vallon and Webber corroborated his
          story. He told of his long association
          with Becker, of police corruption
          which existed as Rosenthal had charg- .1
          ed, ol thousands collected by Becker
          for police protection and, finally, of
          nls commission by Becker to arrange
          to have Rosenthal killed by gunmen—
          a commission he executed.
          That night, July 29, 1912, District
          Attorney Whitman summoned the
          grand jury by telephone and telegraph,
          laid his evidence before it and within
          two hours obtained the indictment of
          Becker on a charge of murder.
          Four east side gangsters were in
          dicted as the actual murderers. Rose
          had testified that these men were as
          signed by "Big Jack" Zelig, a gang
          leader who had been arrested by
          Becker's men on a trumped-up charge,
          to do the murder. They were to re
          ceive $1,000 and Zesig was to be re
          leased. Zelig's orders had been issued
          from the Tombs to the gunmen.
          These gunmen-known in the streets
          of tho east side as "Gyp the Blood"
          Horowitz, "Lefty Louis" Rosenberg,
          "Dago Frank" Ciroflci and "Whitey"
          Lewlb—were rounded up one by one.
          The last two were arrested, "Gyp the
          Blood" and "Lefty Louie" were not
          found till September, hiding in a
          Brooklyn flat. With them were found
          their young wives, who, to divert sui
          picion, had dyed their light hair dark!
          Case: i- Complete.
          To give standing to the testimony of
          Becker's three accomplices who had
          turned informers—Rose, Webber and
          Vallon—a corroborating witness wttf
          was not implicated was needed. Sam
          Schepps, a dapper little gambler who
          had fled the city, was the man who
          could do this. He was found at Hot
          Springs, Ark,, brought back to New
          York and the people's case against
          Charles Becker was complete. It went
          to trial on October 7,1912.
          A verdict of guilty of first degree
          murder was returned at midnight
          October 24, 1912, after the jury had
          deliberated seven hours and fifty-seven
          minutes. Becker was sentenced six
          days later to die 1 the electric chair
          during the week of December 9, 1912.
          Within less than amonth the four gun
          men were placed on trial as the actual
          slayers, found guilty and sent to the
          death house.
          More than a year later, on Febru
          ary 24, 1914, the court of appeals de
          cided that Becker should have a new
          trial. The gunmen's conviction was up
          held and they paid the penalty with
          their lives on April 14, 1914, One of
          the number, "Dago Frank" confessed
          the guilt of his three associates but
          maintained his own innocence. His
          confession, made on the eve of the
          execution, became known the day they
          were put to death.
          Becker was brought back to the|
          Tombs. His second trial was begun
          May 6, 1914, and ended May 22, with a
          verdict of guilty. He was sentenced to
          die during the week of July 6, 1914.
          An appeal was filed, but the convio
          tion was upheld by the higher court
          in a decision handed down May 25.
          last, and the date of the execution waa
          set for the week beginning July 12.
          Later appeals postponed the excution
          till today.
          Wife Loyal To Becker.
          Throughout Becker's troubles his
          wife remained loyal to him and was
          his constant adviser. She labored ap
          parently without tiring his behalf,
          assisting his counsel in every way pos
          sible. She appeared to be crushed
          when the Court of Appeals upheld his
          second conviction, but soon turned
          her energies toward eleventh-hour
          work to save him. It was largely at her
          urgng that he joined In the plan to ask

          There was one other women who!
          if reports are true, followed Becker's
          career through the courts as closely
          as his own wife did. This was Herman
          Rosenthal's widow. Soon after Beck

          Scientists Have Just Discovered
          Many Secrets Which Have Long
          Puzzled Them in Regard to Death
          by Electric Shock From the Exper
          ience of a Man Who Was Electro
          cuted and Brought ?
          Back to Life
          WHKN the electric chair was sub
          stituted for the old fashioned
          gallows in New York it was be
          cause it was believed that electrocution
          was painless. But just what were the
          sensations of death in the electric chair
          scientists were unable to say, because
          no electrocuted victim came back to life
          to tell tliern.
          It was assumed that the shock of the
          powerful current would instantly render
          the condemned man unconscious. But
          the unpleasant feature of m^st electro
          cutions has been the necessity of re
          penting the shock several times. This
          was not foreseen
          Experience in ilie death chamber has
          shown that the electric current does
          not usually destroy life at the tirst shock.
          Evidences of pulsating life compel the
          executioner to turn on the current asain
          and yet again. This distressing failure
          of the electric charge to instantly end
          life has caused much speculation among
          scientists and humanitarians.
          Does the first shock end the conscious
          ness of the condemned man?
          Or is the victim siiil conscious?hover
          ing between death and life, does themau
          In the chair realize what is going on?
          What, if any, was the agony of the
          ti rs ? shock?
          What were the agonies of the victim
          during the moments elapsing between
          tiie tirst shock and the second impact of
          the current? Was he entirely uncon
          scious, partly conscious or fully conscious
          of the horrors of the situation which the
          law never meant to be inflicted on him?
          And if the tirst shock of the current
          benumbed the condemned man's brain,
          did returning consciousness bring with it
          tortures of bodily misery which have
          never been known or suspected?
          The Victim \
          Falls Apparently Dead.
          Nobody has been able to answer these
          questions until an accident happened
          viiit-h unexpectedly illuminated this wholo
          subject of what the victim in the elec
          tric chair really sees, hears, foels and
          cu ffers.
          It was the morning of February 3 that
          Harry Ton sous pushed his hand truck
          of steel castings into th^ freight elevator
          of the National Screw and Tack Com
          pany. in Cleveland. His left foot stepped
          firmly on a "live" wire, which had ac
          cidentally become detae.hed from the elec
          tric controller of the elevator. Tonious'
          face paled. He dropped the truck, ut
          tered a heartrending cry, and fell lifeless
          to the floor.
          The ambulance surgeon, who soon ar
          rived with two police attendants, declared
          that Tonious was dead and that it was
          a Coroner's case. Hut hoping that some
          thing might be done to resuscitate the
          man, the surgeon ordered the body to be
          brought to the hospital for experiments
          with the pulrnotor.
          After vigorous work the left leg of
          Tonious was seen 14V(remhie slightly. On?
          of the physician^ h?ahed over and put
          his ear to the man's breast. There was
          a slight flutter heard.
          The pulmotor was applied more vigor
          ously than ever. Other measures for re
          suscitation were taken and before long
          the "dead" man's body stirred and his
          lips moved. The next moment his eye
          lids fluttered and lie shook his shoulderp,
          as if throwing off a heavy load. Sub
          consciously his left hand moved in the
          direction of the left foot?the member
          which had come in contact with the wire.
          One of the doctors opened one of the
          kirn's eyes and saw the eyeball roll to
          one side, and then back again. Life was
          beginning to assert Itself, and a moment
          later Tonious tried to rise, but was held
          fast by toe attendants, delighted that the
          object of their attention had been brought
          back to life.
          Life returned by leaps and bounds and
          the "dead" man was soon able to open
          his eyes ami talk. Two days later Tonious
          was allowed to stand and walk a f"\v
          steps. His whole bodj was still weak
          and he was extremely nervous. His feet
          could scarcely bear the weigh; of his
          frame. (
          He regained his strength quickly, and

          The doctors i< ::li/.f,d tin: in the person
          of the uiifo: Tonious they had a
          man who lia l virtually been through all
          the experiences >>r an eloctrocuted vic

          heretofore always been burled with the

          Pressed 'or information on all the as
          pects of : i- :? markab'.e experience,
          Tonious said:
          "Dying wa- quick and without much
          pain. Coming ba< to life was slow and
          very painful.
          "When 1 stared to hacK out of the
          elevator." Toniou continued, " I recall
          stepping "ti the wire. I could feel it
          under my fe>ot. Then ! felt a teirible
          jolt on thf- back of my head It felt as
          if some one had struck me there with a
          club. 1 remember having cried out, but
          my voice seemed to trail off in tin* nis
          taace. It felt as if a bomb bad been
          inserted in rny skull and as if it bad
          exploded and blown off the top of my
          head.
          . "Then it aeemed as if a million needles
          nnd pins were shooting through my body.
          They pricked all at the same time. The
          top of my head seemed to rise. 1 felt
          the ground giving way under my feet as
          ?if I were on the brink of a precipice the
          edge of which had crumbled under me.
          I felt myself falling. There was nothing
          to support me. 1 realized that no part of
          mv body was moving of its own accord,
          but the whole of me kept falling. All this
          appeared to be in a short space of titer,
          probably no more than a few seconds,
          ami then finally l felt as if i were float
          ing in space. 1 couldn't see. hear, smell
          or feel anything, and then suddenly oil
          was a blank. I just couldn't think or re
          member anything.
          "I remember now that, when I stepped
          oil the wire 1 felt no sensation in my leg
          ft'r foot. It was al! in my he'.l. At the
          time, after realizing I had stepped on a
          wire, I forgot all about my leg nnd foot.
          Only my head was in pain, "fliera was
          no mark or burn on either my shoe, my
          sock, or my foot. The pain of the jolt
          and the explosion in my head and of the
          needles and pins through my body was
          intense.
          "After my mind had been a blank. 1
          don't know how long, as I had no idea
          of tim? or anything else, I began to hear.
          .My first realization was of the sound of
          rushing water or a heavy wind. Il sound
          ed like when you stand on ihe beach at
          'lie lake when the waves are lil^h -a
          sort of roaring sound. I heard the roar
          ing first, and what seemed then like a few
          minutes later the sound increased and 1
          could hear a kind of whistle, like the wind
          makes. When I first began to hear it
          seemed as if I had been holding my ears
          shut, keeping out all the sound, arid then
          gradually releasing the pressure, the
          sound growing louder and louder.
          "While 1 didn't realize I was coming
          b-iek to life. I did think that whatever
          had happened I had been hearing the
          noise for a lonrr time. It seemed hours.
          I didn't realize wlm! was going on, my
          only impression being that I was hearing
          something.
          "As the. sounds grew louder, as if
          bigger waves were dashing on the beach
          and the force of the wind had increased,

          they started to swish back and forth.
          'I hat is, it seemed to me as if the sounds
          moved, if that were possible. They would
          grow dim and I thought they were going
          away from me. and then they would come
          nearer. I didn't consider whether I could

          1 didn't wonder where 1 was or what had
          happened to me. I just kept thinking of
          those sounds.

          of the Prison's
          Veteran Guards
          Br EDWARD T. KAVANAUGH.
          T"T TEIRD arid thrilling have been
          A some of the experiences of
          ' George Meserole and two
          other veteran Blag Bine keepers, lately'
          retired, with numerous murderers, fa-
          mous or Infamous, during many years
          they were on the death watch over
          the prison's efclls set apart for pris
          oners awaiting execution,
          Meserole, whoso keen eyes for twenty-six
          years kept a lookout over thoso
          closely guarded cells. Is only now un-
          folding some Interesting stories of
          what has gone on In there. John Der-
          renbachcr, who kept vigil over the
          ' death cells nine years, and Alexander
          Van Wart, who did relief duty there
          for a similar period, have likewise
          elected to talk. With official consent
          rof Warden Edward V. Brophy they
          feel at liberty to give their reminis
          cences. Many -of the epldaaes de
          scribed have never before been writ'
          ten.
          Meserole'a Fumona Charges.
          Meserole had by far the longest
          deathhouie experience and came In
          contact with its most celebrated In
          mates, such as Albert T.Patrick ac
          cused of the murder of William Rice,
          the millionaire, whose 6cntenco was
          finally commuted: Roland Mollneux,
          first convicted and later" acquitted oi
          the murder of Mrs. Katherlne Adams:
          D- Samuel Kennedy, charged with the
          murder of Dolly Reynolds, who was
          afterward retried and discharged, and
          m ntiita -n,VAt nAl1rA 1lutfnnn. who
          was convicted for the murder of Ro
          senthal, the gambler. These and other
          distinguished prisoners were entrusted
          to Meserole' keeping. Two hundred
          condemned persons, including three
          women, have been received In his time.
          Standing between a condemned mur
          derer facing death in the electric
          chair and his freedom, the watchman's
          task in the condemned cells Is a tick
          lish one. A murJerer condemned to
          die has nothing to lose by Killing a
          guard to make a getaway. The temp
          tation to attack his guard Is, therefore.
          obvious. Yet none of these three
          keepers ever received even a scratch,
          nor' had a suicide or scape on his tour
          of duty. Tet they have guarded scores
          of dangerous murderers. Other guards
          have hrid murder, suicide and escapes
          on their shifts.
          Comedy and Tragedy.
          Both comedy 'and tragedy figure In
          r these three veterans' adventures. For
          example. Meserole well remembers tno
          "day in 1916 that Hyman Ltebman,

          as the doctors pumped away, and had
          to confess he was faking so they
          would stop the pump. Then, on the
          pathetic side, there was the proceo
          slon of seven hearses up to the prison
          front door on the eve of the execution
          of Vincent Colli and six other slayers
          In Warden Kennedy's time. This was
          the largest number ever executed In
          one batch.

          duties were firm and fearless. They
          were able to match their wits and
          their daring against thoso of their
          chargos, whether they be murderer
          of the shrewd typo or more brutes.
          Meserole had fearlessness Instilled in

          trie apparatus for the first electric
          execution arrived at the prison.
          New Tork State had just passed a
          law substituting the electric chair for
          the hangman's noose. There had
          never been an electric execution and
          everybody was prospecting as to who
          would be the first person electrocuted
          and'whether he would bo killed with
          out conscious suffering or tortured to
          death. f
          On October 30, 1889, Warden Brush
          received Charles McElvalne, aged
          twenty, the first person sentenced to
          the electric-' chair., He had- slain
          Christian Lucca In Brooklyn. There
          had been no deathhouse built then.
          So"McElvalne was placed' in a cell on
          the upper floor of tho hospital building
          end kepA In 'solitary conflneme'nt;-' On
          December 5, 1889, work of building tho
          deathhouse was begun. It was to be,
          virtually, a prison within a prison.
          Derrenbachcr saw Thomas Palllster,
          a prisoner, helping to build it. By
          an odd turn of events, this same pris
          oner was later convicted of murder
          and lodged, two years later, in the
          prison death cells himself. He was
          never executed. He cheated the chair
          by escaping,
          Deathhouse Snon Crowded.
          Soon as the deathhouse was finished
          McKlvalne became Its first occupant.
          Derrenbacher was his first guard
          there. Ho would keep watch over the
          condemned murderer eleven hours a
          day. McElvalne hud not the exclusive
          use of' the deathhouse long. On New
          Year's day Sheheok Julglgo, a Japa
          nese, was received from Manhattan
          for killing Seaman Coutaln, a Japanese
          sailor.
          Then came Joseph Woodwho killed
          Charles Ruflln, a laborer on the new
          Croton aqueduct at Klngsbrldge, fol
          lowed a few weeks later by Harris
          Smller, who shot Mary Dralney, one ot
          his three bigamous wives, and then by
          James J. Blocum, a baseball player,
          whtf beat his wife to death.
          There was room for only four In the
          original deathhouse, so Smller was
          placed in the hospital loft. Keeper
          Fagan, on watch there, fell asleep one
          night while on duty. Principal Keeper
          James Connaughton, a rigorous dis
          ciplinarian, discovered him In the midst
          of his nap. He rebuked and suspended
          Fagan immediately. Next came Nicola
          Trcrzq, the murderer who was aiter
          ward saved by Gov. Flower, who com
          muted his sentence to life imprison
          ment. An addition was built to the death-
          house so It could accommodate eight
          men. On his -shift Derrenbacher alone
          in the deathhouse watched six mur
          derers. As they were cramped badly
          In the, brick cells, Moserole was as
          signed by Connnughtop.ln 1891 to take
          each murderer out hls cage a half
          hour a day for exercise. McElvalne,
          of a nervous nature, often bored
          Meserole and the other keepers by
          scratching his cell bars In filing his
          finger nails or using his bunk sheot to
          swat flies with.
          Horse Used to Test Chair
          As tho time drew near for tho first
          execution, Warden Brush wished to
          test the killing capacity of the new
          contrivance. So on Nov. 20, 1890, a
          horse was taken from the prison stable
          and fastened to the death chair In a
          room adjoining tho condemned colls,
          where Derrenbacher was on duty. The
          keepers fastened a hood, over the
          horse's head, as they do now over tho
          cranium of a murderer, and tied the
          steed fast to the chair.
          As the current was turned on a fuse
          blew out and the horso got only a part
          of the shock that was meant for It. It
          made a weird shrieking noise and
          kicked the wall furiously.
          The commotion Btartled Slocum.
          "What's that?" asked the wife slayer.
          Derrenbacher knew they were testing
          the chair, but would not add to
          Slocum's mental torture. "It s only a
          horse kicking," replied the keeper,
          Little did Slocum realize they were
          trying out tho chair to use on the
          deathhouse Inmates. Or that destiny
          intended that he should be the first
          person ever to sit in it

          ordeal of his long prison career oil July
          7, 1891, the day of the first executions.
          The whole prison was astir and all the
          murderers In the deathhouse were in
          a frenzy. Outside a morbid mob lined
          the hills overlooking tho prison and
          the streets looking to it
          Warden Brown had pledged all who
          would have access to the condemned
          cells and the death chamber to se
          crecy. Newspaper reporters were not
          only forbidden to see the execution
          (they hod been allowed to witness
          hangings) but the warden put out
          armed sentries and kept them off the
          prison property entirely. He had a
          cordon ot guards form a "dead line."
          Sentries paced back and forth with
          rifles to overawe tho crowd and shoot
          anybody who might attempt to -.slip
          through tno line. Tno warden, ior
          going to such pains, was JJorover after
          ward called 'Deadline" Brown.
          However, Brown arranged a code of
          signals to let reporters and others
          know when each of the four prisoners
          to be electrocuted was dead. He se
          lected a white (lag for Sloqum, a blue
          flag for Smller, a black flag for Wood
          and a red flag for Julglgo. When each
          man was dead his flag was to go up
          the halyards on the root of the war
          den's residence. So the thousands
          awaiting outside the prison -riveted
          their gaze on the flagpole.
          Derrenbacher was told to get Slocum
          ready first. He bid the unfortu
          nate feilow good-by nnd about noon
          Slocum was taken on the death march
          to the execution chamber a few yards
          away. State Detective -James Jack
          son and Keeper Sylvester McNeal
          quickly strapped him in the chair. The
          electrodes were jammed down on his
          head, the mask drawn over his face,
          and Dr. Carlos Macdonald, the alienist,
          signalled the executioner to pull the
          switch. Tho current shot on, Slocum
          lunged forward and tugged at the
          straps. Tho first shock had left him
          unconscious, but another was given
          him to make death certatn. Slowly
          went the white flag up tho halyards

          HAKESPEARE has intimated that
          ) the province ot the stage is to
          "hold the mirror up to Nature."
          Therefore his plays, first published by
          two actors of his company, are sup
          posed to reflect the manners of his
          time. Coming down through the plays
          of Congreve, Wycherley and Far-
          quanar, Hlcnard urinsiey Hlierman, to.

          Wing Plnero and Henry Arthur Jones,
          all ot theso authors refer to drink and
          drinkers, either in a comic or a tragic
          manner, to point or adorn a talc. But
          now that prohibition has come upon
          us and hard stuff is no longer expected
          to exist, scenes of Intoxication on the
          stage will presumably be taboo.
          This leads us to recall various In

          called upon to simulate Inebriety, and
          some of these recollections are quaint

          gaining recognition as one of the fore
          most actors of the day. By a curious

          In Roehl's cell. Then, with a coal
          shovel, they battered their way out by
          breaking a hole In the roof. A furious

          famous murderer of pretty Helen
          Potts, his jilted sweetheart, and two
          other slayers, but these men expected
          Executive clemency nnd refused to go.
          Later two' bodies wero found In the
          Hudson River attired In prison uni
          forms. The prison officials Idcntllled
          them as Uiobo of Palllster and Roeln.
          There was a bullet hole in each. The
          officials concluded tho two murderers
          quarrelled as to whether they should
          risk a trip in the small dory they stole
          across the rough river In tho raging
          storm or turn back, and that they shot
          each other fighting for possession ot

          Governor .had refused to reprieve him
          and that he had better prepare to die
          at noon.
          Shortly afterward he saw Harris slip
          something into his mouth and hastily
          swallow It. Derrenbacher Informed
          Warden- Durston and on approaching
          his cell the Warden noticed Harris
          looked rather dazed.
          He prdered the cell unlocked. But
          Harris had forestalled such a move.
          He had stuffed the keyhole with wads
          ot paper and the key could not be
          forced Into the lock. So keepers ran
          for hammers and other tools and be
          gan smashing and ripping the lock off
          the cell door. When they got It open
          Harris had swooned on the bed.
          He had taken a powerful dose of
          arugs his mother was thought to have
          smuggled to htm with Intention of
          killing himself. Physicians waiting to
          see him executed forced medicine
          down the prisoner's throat and soon
          restored him to consciousness. Keeper
          McNeal was then stationed In the cell
          with him' and sat Wsldo him until
          Derrenbacher opened the door and
          Harris was taken to his doom.
          Mrs. Harris had sent a casket to
          receive the body. On the cover
          Warden Durston discovered under the

          amused by bibulous characters on tho
          stage.
          Thomas Q. Seabrooke was at one
          tlmo a popular star In comic opera,
          nnd year after year reappeared as the
          bacchanalian ruler of ''The Isle of
          Champagne," gaining fnme and for
          tune In his tours from coast to coast.
          At the same period Frank Daniels
          gained applause through similar pres
          entations, and at a somewhat later
          date Richard Carle Btarted Btagger

          stars of comic opera portrayed at one
          time or another varying degrees of
          Inebriety nnd "drinking songs" and
          cllnklng goblets were part nnd parcel
          ot these performances.
          One of the characters In "Little
          Johnny Jones," an early success of
          George M. Cohan's, was a follow who
          staggered on and off the stago from
          time to time, but never said a word.
          Nevertheless, a hit was made, Broad
          way appreciating a novelty. A few
          seasons ago Mr. Cohan produced a
          piece called "Hlt-lhe-TrpIl Holllday,"
          .apparently suggosted by the antics nnd
          activities of Billy Sunday. As acted
          by Mr. Cohan's brother-in-law, Fred
          Nlblo, the title role was highly divert
          ing. Oldtlmers will recall the piny, called
          "Drink," an adaptation by Charles
          eade of the novel by Emtio Zola.
          Charles Warner, the father of H. B.
          Warner, starred In this piece and
          toured the world with It, holding audi

          Matthew Johnson, another murderer,
          prior to being electrocuted February
          26, 1894, plotted to kill Derrenbacher.
          He had already taken throe lives, ad
          mlttedly. so, naturally, he thought
          noth'jis of taking the guard's too. As
          Derrenbacher was about to open John
          Ron's cell he overheard a friendly
          prisoner admonish the brute: "Don't
          do " It." Derrenbacher left tho cell
          locked then until ho could remove the
          big Are shovel nnd heavy poker from
          the stove and lock them up. Then he
          let Johnson out to exercise, but
          watched him carefully.

          N.Y.
          Notorious In bygone days was Dr.
          Robert Buchanan, executed on July 1,
          1895, for tho slaying of Anna Suther
          land. In the forenoon Principal Keeper
          Connaughton told Meserole to take
          Buchanan's mother In to seo him and
          that she could remain only one hour.
          Meserole let her overstay several min
          utes out ot sympathy. Connaughton,
          unsympathetic, -took him to task for
          It. Mrs. Buchanan rat, hysterical, In
          Warden Sage's residence whilo her son
          was being killed In the death chamber.
          Mnrle nurberl Saved From Death,
          Meserole recalls tho" occasion when
          he was stationed over Marie Barberl,
          the first woman ever sentenced id the
          electric chair. She killed her wooer,
          Domlnlco Cataldo. In New York, and
          was received by Warden Sage on July
          15, 1895, Meserole, on his own re
          sponsibility, let her and the matron
          out of a stuffy room they were lodged
          In on the top floor of the hospital and
          gave them the freedom of the open
          attic. Meserole, always a Judgo of
          beauty, said: "She was the homeliest
          woman I ever saw." Later sho got a
          neir trial and wnp discharged.
          Meserole was doing Ciathhouse duty
          when the only condemned murderer
          there who ever died a natural death
          expired. William Caesar, 32, who took
          the life of Mary Martin In New York,
          succumbed Feb. 1. 1896, to heart trou
          ble. Although an Inmate doctor pro
          nounced Caesar iead, as did an Inmate
          nurao and the keepers, Connaughton
          was apprehensive. He removed the body
          to a dark cell and ordered Keeper
          Hopper to stand watch over it all
          night. "He might come back to life,"
          said Connaughton. Hopper, Indig
          nant, protected that he hai hired his
          services to the State to guard living
          I prisoners and not to "prevent corpses
          I running
          away or attend prison
          wakes." However, he had to watch
          the body all night.

          A few nlghtB later when Carl Fie
          genbaum was put In the dead man's
          cell he leaped up oft his cot suddenly
          and, screaming with feaf, said that the
          cell was haunted. "Caesar's ghost
          tried to choke met" exclaimed the ter
          , rifled murderer who hnd choked his
          , wife to death In New York. Dr. Rob-
          1 ert Irvine, prison surgeon, gave the
          frlghtenol prisoner a stimulant and
          had' htm taken out of the "haunted'
          cell.
          When John H. Barker arrived from
          White Plains In 189C to await exe
          cution It was disclosed that he used to
          work for Meserole, He was stalilr
          groom and formerly looked after the
          keeper's race horse. Meserole also
          tells how a guard got locked In the
          autopsy shed, adjoining the death
          house, and had to stay there all night,
          In the dingy room was a murderer's
          body and outside the door was the
          carcass ot another horse killed In the

          York in cahoots with Mrs, Nack, This

          said Van Wart.
          Van Wart escorted to the chair
          Adrian Braun. who killed his wife in

          Brnun Is the only person ever im
          prisoned in "murderer's row" before
          Indicted or brought to trial.
          As soon as the crimp was committed
          Warden Sage ordered State Detectlvo'
          James Jackson, who witnessed the
          murder, to lock Braun up In tho death
          house. He was later tried, convicted
          and sentenced to death In White Plains'
          and returned to tho deathhouse. He
          died Mny 29, 1899.
          Saved Ur Another' Confraalon,
          Meserole and Van Wart recall Ed
          ward Wise, who was In the deathhouse
          for a murder which a man on his death
          bd In England confessed he and not
          Wise had committed. Scotland Yard
          detectives notlfled the authorities hero
          and Wise's sentence was commuted to
          life Imprisonment. John L. Sullivan,
          .prizefighter, later Interceded to get
          . WIbo out ot prison.
          Meserole was' a deathhouso guard
          the eventful morning Antonio Ponton
          was going to the chair on January 7,
          1916. He had killed MIrs Bessie
          Kromer, a Schenectady school teacher.
          Just ns Principal Keeper Fred Dorncr
          was taking Ponton out of his cell for
          the walk to the chair with Father Will
          lam E. Cashln, his spiritual adviser,
          Joseph Hlll a burglar and "trusty,"
          tried to escape from the main prison.
          Ponton was thrust back In his cell and
          tho door locked. The deep silence In
          the death chamber where Dr. H. E.
          Morencss, Prison Secretary Daniel J,
          Hlckey, other officials and witnesses'
          were waiting for tho execution, was
          broken by gruff shouts of keepers, the
          screaming of convicts nnd tho Bound of
          flying feet. Hill was up on tho roof,
          about to drop off to freedom, and tho
          guards were chasing him. When ho
          was recaptured tbe guards returned
          to the execution scene. Ponton was'
          again taken out, and this time shunted
          off ,ln the chair.
          Guard Killed Ur Trlaoner,
          Meserole was stationed In tho con
          demned cells over Orcsta Shlllltano.
          An hour after he went home ono-sum-mer
          night In 1916, the young mur
          derer induced Keeper McCarthy to
          open his cell door. He pulled out a
          hidden revolver, shot McCarthy fatally
          and wounded Keeper 'Bullard. Un
          armed the keepers wero helpless. He
          locked them up In cells with tho
          wounded guard's keys, shinned over
          thp exercise yard wall and got out Into
          the walled yard of the prison. Doffing
          his clothes he scaled tho river front
          fence and swam out Into the Hudson
          and around tho walls to shore. As he
          was nude he did not get far. The
          prison whistle roared out an alarm
          and the fugitive was retaken n half
          mile away. He was put to des th soon
          afterward.
          While working alongside Meserole,
          Keeper John J. Kennedy In the sum
          mer of 1915 snatched a strong oord
          two feet long Antonio Mangenaro, an
          Erlo county murderer, wn weaving In
          his cell, away from him. Taking wadi
          of cotton batting, given him by Dr.
          Charles Farr to bathe n sore eye, the
          prisoner finally secreted a sufficient
          quantity to make a rope to commit
          suicide. A weaver by trade, he mode
          an excellent cord, but had his trouble
          all for naught. Later on tho courts
          gave htm a new trial and he escaped
          the chair by due process ot law.
          In 1909 two murderers In a suicide
          pact hung themselves at the same In
          stant on Meserole's tour of duty. Ho
          heard choking and gasping, Climbing
          up onto the top ot one cell he cut down
          one of them. Tho other, evidently
          penitent, was writhing and shrieking.
          "Just hold on there," said Meserole,
          "nnd I'll be over to you In a minute."
          He leaped to the top of the cell across
          the passageway and cut down the sec
          ond trickster.
          The conspirators had flgured that If
          both swung oft together ono would be
          bound to succeed while tho watchman
          was busy rescuing the other. But
          Meserole was a match for both.
          In fact, since tho death cells were
          established, thirty years ago, only one
          murderer ever cheated tho law by sui
          cide. Angelo Legglo frustrated the
          guards and hung himself with some
          of his clothing on January 13, 1916
          when Profeseor George W. Kirch''"
          was the prison warden.

          The Cleveland Men Claim That

          Cochran or do one else could be allow-'
          ed to speak unless to present the name
          of a candidate. Cockran replied that
          he was there to second the nomination
          of Judge Thurman and he wns allow
          ed to proceed in mucn contusion, lie
          said he was too warm friend of Cleve
          land's to want to see him
          subjected to the humiliation of defeat
          which was greeted with laughter and
          confusion. Cochran maintained furth
          er that Thurman was the man who
          only could unite and lead the grand
          old" party of Jackson on to victory.
          Portions of his speech were well re
          ceived and frequently applauded.
          lie closed by saying that
          some of the members of the cou
          vcutiou thought that Cleveland could
          carry the country, while others
          thought that he could not. One side
          or the other must be wrong, then why
          take finv chances when all could unite
          ou the old wheel-horse Thurman.
          Another motion was made to sus
          pend the order of business for a recess,
          which was amended to a motion to
          adjourn, and on a call of the roll of
          states the conventional 6:20 adjourned
          until 10:30 a. m. to-morrow.
          at 6:30 p. m. the rules were suspende
          and a reces9 taken till 10:30 to-morrow

          reduction of taxation can be bad with
          out hurt to the wages of labor.
          The plank in the platform closes by I
          declaring that all taxation shall be ex-

          marks placing hi nomination Gover
          nor Cleveland, Lockwood spoke as
          follows: A little more than three
          j years ago I had the honor at the city
          ' of Buffalo to present the name of this
          ' same gentleman for the office of may

          not in the high places. The peoolc
          looked lor a man who would represent
          the coutrory, and without any hesita
          tion they named G rover Cleveland as
          the man.
          At this noiut there was a wild burst
          , of applause. Some of the New York
          delegation, practically the Wisconsin

          Resolved, that it is the sense of this
          convention that its action vesterday

          tor Grady, of New York, was in
          tended to apply only to delegations

          committee on platform and rules.
          Mr. Grady of Xew York I suggest
          that that resolution to be entirely
          proper should read, "The amendment
          offeied by Mr. Grady.'
          The Chair The "gentleman (refer

          THURMAN OAININQ.
          Ciiicaoo, July 9. The situation as
          it appears at midnight Is still more
          favorable for Thurman, notwithstand
          ing the claims of the Cleveland men,
          which arc loud and long. California
          presented his name and Arkansas has
          decided to swing in for the red bin
          dann. Ohio is now unanimous. Cleve
          land is ouly allowed 389 votes all told.
          Cleveland's torces recognize the fact
          that the sooner the convention gets to
          balloting the better will be his chances.
          They are beginning to ask what Cleve
          land's sentiments are. Nobody knows
          much about him, except so fur as his
          action iu the gubernatorial
          chair indicates his view, and the
          only conclusion that can be drawn
          from his gubernatorial acts is that his
          sympathies arc with corporations and
          iu favor of all kinds of monopolies.

          BUTLER'S PLANK.
          Chicago, July 9. The Daily News
          reports the following as General But
          ler's tariff plank :
          Resolved, That customs duties
          should be levied for the purpose of
          raising revenue for the nccessarv ex
          penses of the government, and to pro
          tect and foster American industries
          j and protect American labor; that raw
          inatenal manufactured in this country
          should come in free, as should also the
          necessaries which arc used on the poor
          man's table, such as tea, coffee, etc.,
          aud that the tariff ou luxuries should
          be placed at the highest limit.
          THE KANSAS DELEGATION.
          Chicago, July 9 In the Kansas
          delegation there are five votes for
          Bayard, which under the unit rule
          would be given to Cleveland, because
          fourteen of tho delegates voted for
          Cleveland. There is scarcely a state
          which is unanimous for any one can

          The Tribune nWo gave estimates of
          the first ballot, giving Butler '29 and
          McDonald 72.
          Tho crowil about the convention
          hall before the hour of opening was
          imply immense. Thurman, who en.
          tcred the hall previous to a call to or
          der, was loudly cheered. There was
          no little, uneasiness over the rumor
          that Tamm.-iuv had resolved not to '
          give up i he fight, but to re-opeu tho
          question of tho unit rule on some sub
          sidiary motion.
          The convention was railed lo order
          at 11:27. Before order wan full- hud
          it was the talk throughout the hall
          that Duller had gotie home, bin some
          one announced publicly that he was

          young men of the country, tho new

          name of Gov. Cleveland as its stand
          ard hearer for the next four years.
          I shall indulgo In no eu
          logy of Mr. Cleveland. I
          shall not attempt any further descrip
          tion of his political career. It is
          known; his Democracy is known; his
          statesmanship is know throughout the
          length aud breadth of this land. All I
          ask of this convention is, let no pergon
          al prejudice influence their duty
          which they owe to the people
          of this country. Be not deceived.
          (J rover Cleveland can give
          I hu democratic party the thirty-six
          electoral votes of the state of New
          York on election day. He cau by his
          mirity of character, by his purity of

          that the plank relating to' the tariff',
          after it is adopted by the convention,
          shall be telegraphed to him, and that
          ho be requested to inform the conven
          tion what he thinks about it. This is
          not probable, however,for Cleveland's
          friends, who will be iuthe inujority
          on the committee on resolutions, will
          not permit anything of the kind to be
          done.

          Cleveland to-night. It is urged upon
          the western and southern delegates
          that Tammany should not be allowed
          terri- l0 poini oui mo rwau ior uiu na

          two more votes iu the Iowa delegation
          have fallen off from Cleveland and
          while, a &trong effort is being
          made with the delegation
          I to vote solidly on the first ballot for
          Cleveland it is now stated that he will
          onlv have nineteen votes. The air of
          the Cleveland people, however, is one
          of irrcat confidence They sav, it
          essary, they can nominate him on
          first hallot, and certainly on the sec
          ond. That ali of Pennsylvania and a
          portion of New Jersey will come to
          him when the sign is given.

          I The statement that Butler was out

          that General Butler would be placed
          iu nomination to-morrow, but would
          say positively that he had not been
          withdrawn.

          Kansas City, July 9. A Chicago
          special to the Kansas City Times
          makes up the followiug estimates of
          the situation: The Cleveland men are
          highlv elated over their success in
          beating Johu Kelley, by securing the
          indorsement of the convention in sus
          taining the unit rule. In the New
          York delegation they confidently as
          sert that their favorite candidate is
          now certain of the nomination, and
          that the opposition will be unable to
          ' combine on auy candidate against him.
          There is danger, howcver,thut import
          ant errors may be made by the over-
          ! confident Cleveland men in formiug
          their estimate of his strength. The
          affirmative vote on the unit
          rule was only 462 which
          the opposition claims represents the
          whole of Cleveland's strength iu the
          convention In this, of course, is in
          cluded a large number of votes from
          several stales having candidates of
          their own, as Pennsylvania, Delaware,
          Ohio and Indiana, whose votes de
          ducted will very largely reduce Cleve
          land's total; so much so that his op-
          ponent's claim he can never secure the
          coveted two thiids vote necessary to
          nominate him. lie may also lose some
          votes on account of the feeling aroused
          by the arbitrary action or the chair
          man of the New York delegation iu cn
          ' forcing the unit rule and casting the
          seventy-two votes against Grady's
          amendment. Notwithstanding these
          elements of weakness, the Cleveland
          boom is liable to grow as steadily as
          Blaine's did.
          The grand welcome extended Thur
          man in tho convention has cucouraged
          the Ohio men' to greater efforts iu his
          behalf. I do not regard his cindidacy
          as daugerous, but in Bayaid I recog
          nize the most formidable candidate
          Tgainst the popular Cleveland He is
          gaining ground, and if the convention
          should be prolonged to a bitter light
          he may be settled oiuis the candidate
          i toilefcat the New York candidate.
          ' Iu the event of a failure bv Clove-,
          laud's forces to muster sufficient
          strength to be successful, and if Thur-
          i man, Bayard and McDonald should
          ! decline to pool their issues, a dark
          horse is probable. The supporters of
          Field, Randall, Slocum and Carlisle
          are hoping for a wrangle of this kind,
          i believing that if it occur they can
          succeed. It is gratifying in all this
          violent political strife to know that
          that any of the candidates named are
          strong aud pure men, each with a
          blameless record and capable of lead
          ing Democracy on to victory. While
          ",ie John Kelly is deeply mortified at his
          n(!c" defeat, a united party may be relied
          1 ",c on iu yew York should Cleveland
          be nominated. Tho canvass made by
          his friends has been a remarkable one.
          "It has not bocn over two weeks,-'
          said Hon. Johu B. Fellows of New
          York to-night, "since we insti
          gated the movement that promises so
          brilliantly to rule in Guv. Cleveland's
          nomination, lie has been very indif
          ferent and his succe-s is due wholly lo
          the efforts of his friends."
          Probably his great strength is due
          to the endorsement of the revered
          Tildcn more than to any other came.
          Without this, and with the violent
          Tammany opposition, the votes from
          other state- could ncter have been secured.

          THE PLATFORM. ,
          Ciiicaoo. July 9. At midnight the
          committee on pUtform had not com
          pleted its work, having been iu session
          thirty-six hours on the subject of tariff. ;
          A great variety of propositions were
          made. I-ttc iu the nftcNtoon Messrs.
          Hewitt, Valtersou and Hurkc con
          structed out of those proposition a
          tariff plank. This was taken as the
          basis of discussion and it was finally
          shaped so as to meet with the approval
          of all member", of the sub-couiinittec
          except Untler. The plank -o reported
          to the general committee and adopted
          by it declares iu substance as follows :
          That the need of a change in our
          tarifl system is made manifest by the
          excessive revnue; that since the foun
          dation of the government custom
          house duties have furnished its main
          source of reveue: this system must

          of "the government; that the

          noxious to the workingmcu, and that
          he will lose thousands of votes, not
          only in New York state, but in all the
          large cities and manufacturing towns
          throughout the country, and many of

          Whon Illinois was reached Ocn. Palmer
          aroso to announce tho voto and said : 1111-
          SKil nut 1 vntn for Thnirml A. Hendricks!
          nd he paused as if waiting for tho outcome of
          wnfl preconcerted arrangement, uu cuss uu
          eyo toward tho Missouri delegation and appa
          rently In response, Oen. Mansur, of Missouri,
          Jumped up and emitted a terrific yoll. This
          was Immediately taken un bv tho audlcnco.
          and a tremendous shout nroso from all parts of
          mo nan south or tho space aiiottcu to mo ucie
          gates. Tho excitement and nolso swept grad
          ually around among tho audience In tho rear
          of the delegates and rolled In a tremendous
          wave tnrougn ine vast mass oi spectators con
          gregated In tho north wing of the chamber.
          Tho chair rapped splinters offhlstablolnan
          eftbrt to curb the demonstration, but ho might
          ns well have attempted to stop an eruption nf
          Vesuvius with tho tap nf a tack hammer. So
          far tho excitement had been confined to the
          audience, with the exception of a few enthus
          iastic delegates, who, remaining In their scats,
          waved their fans and handkerchiefs.
          At length a little commotion was vlslblo
          In the New York delegation, and the grim
          visage of the gTand sachem of Tammany hall
          was seen slowly rising out of tho confusion.
          Mr. Kellv's month was wldo open, but what
          ever Individual nolso was being emitted by
          the gentleman was drowned In tho frightful
          uproar which had taken possession of tho hall.
          Mr. Kelly's rising appeared to bo tho signal for
          a genera) demonstration on tho part of the
          ami-Cleveland men In tho convention. Dele
          gates In all parts of tho spaco within tho rail
          ing sprang up on their chair, and raised a yell
          of unparallod Intensity, rromlnent among
          the members of tho bodv which assisted In
          creating this section of Bedlam w cro tho dolo
          stations from Indiana, Missouri, Wisconsin,
          Pennsylvania, and tho Tammany end of tho
          Kcw York delegation,
          In the midst of the turmoil tho band struck
          tip "Hall to the Chief," but tho thundering
          noise of the demonstration Increased in voltimo
          until tho strains of music were lost in tho
          deafening uproar. Ono onthitslastlo delegate
          from Indiana, Mr. Gibson, seised tho Indiana
          marker and bore It to tho chairman's desk,
          waging it frantically as ho passed up the aisle,
          and he shouted something at tho chairman's
          ear. Tho chairman, however, refused to
          listen, hut continued to thumo tho desk, with
          his gavel, and Mr. Gibson retired. In tho
          meantime tho audlcnco and delegates vied
          with each other in producing 'cnr-spllttlng
          toolscs, which drowned out tho voices of two
          or three dozen Cleveland men who were
          Dttcmptlng to get the car of tho chair. With
          all this turmoil about him Gov. Hendricks
          I (reserved an external calmness which con
          rastcd strikingly with tho fronsy that pos
          sessed the last assemblage Ho sat as If frozen
          fast to his chair, and resisted tho determined
          efforts of a horde of shouting delegates who
          tried to drag him to his feet. ,
          A numhor of Tammanyltcs resumed their
          teats, but Senator Grady danced about on his
          chair, violently waving n newspaper. Flags,
          handkerchiefs, fahs. hats, and cv en coats and
          shawls wcro brought lntouso by tho Hendricks
          sympathizers in tho audience. All at nnco out
          of tho terrific uproar cgmo aolco llko the blast
          'of a fdg horn, and Mr. Beck, of Indiana, called
          forthr.eo cheers for Thomas A Hendricks. Tho

          good will.

          crowds In tho aisle and ellui up to Chair
          man Vilas's position with a statement that
          Missouri wished to cast Its voto solid for Thos.
          A. Hendricks, but the chair, with a few vigor
          ous thumps of his gavel, which now began tn
          look worn and frayed at tho edges, Inlbrmod
          thfi Mlssourlnn that ho was out of ordor.
          The Hon. James M. Quarlcs, of Tennessee,
          Informed the chair, In a stentorian v oice, that
          blrstato desired to put in nomination Thos.
          A. Hendricks.
          Mr. Quarlcs also tried his hand on the chair
          man, but with no bettor success than that
          achieved by Gen. Munsur. Gen. Bragg, of
          Wisconsin, attempted to get In a word on tho
          score of old friendship and prev lous acquaint
          ance with tho chairman, but Col. Vilas stcrnlv
          .repudiated all personal claims, and continued
          to belabor bis desk and call for order. Out of
          the confusion roso the clarion voice of Secre
          tary Thomas Bel), repeating tho call for tho
          vote of Illinois, but neither' from Illinois nor
          any olhe.1 commonwealth camo any audible
          'response, except yells for Hendricks. Tho
          deafening uproar had now usurped tho rights
          of all other business for a period of eighteen
          minutes. Senator Vaprhecs appeared at tho
          tide of tho chairman" and tho noise and ex
          citement graduully subsided.
          Finally Mr. Voorhees's volcowas heard, call

          The chair said: "Gentlemen of tho conven

          diana has tho floor."
          8ecral delegates attompted to speak, but

          Mr. Mcnzlcs, of Indiana, declared emphati
          cally that Mr. Hendricks was not and could
          not do a candidato lor tho vice presidency.
          Ho had been authorized by Mr. Hendricks
          hlmseirto say so. He, thoroloro, warned the
          convention not to do that which it would havo
          to unno.
          Mr. Walsh, of Georgia, asked Mcnzlcs whether
          ho was authorized to say that Mr. Hendricks
          would not accept the unanimous nomination
          or tho national democratic convention for the
          ofllco of Ira president.
          Mr. Mcnzlcs repeated his statement.
          Mr. Waller, of Connecticut, said his stato
          had surely no desire to force upon Indiana a
          candidato against lis w 111, but this was not an
          Indiana convention. It was a national con
          vention, and the democrats of the country had
          a right to tako a tit man from any placo In it.
          Cheers. If any man said that he knew that
          Mr. Hcudrloks at this time was not patrlotlo
          enough to takeja nomination tendered upon
          thoso circumstances ho would withdraw his
          name, but with humiliation.
          Mr. Wallace, or Pennsylvania, said that Mr.
          Hendricks had been onco chosen vice presi

          Mr. Mcnzc, of Indiana, naked that that
          stato be oxoued from voting. Loud shouts
          of "No I No I" Ho then asked whether thero
          was any namo but Mr. Hendricks beforo tho
          convention, aud, on receiving an answer In tho
          negatlvo from tho chairman, said : "Then, sir,
          tho stato or Indiana casts 30 votes for Thomas
          A. Hondrlcks."
          When tho voto of Indiana was announced for
          nendrlcks, nnd It was apparent that his nomi
          nation was unanimous, tho delegates and the
          audlcnco roso to their feet and lndulccd In tho
          usual extravagant demonstrations. Tho whole
          houso was a tt'.a. of undulating color formed by
          waving handkerchiefs of overy hue, hats, um
          brellas, and everything elso which could bo
          seized on by the excited assemblage.
          Tho band broko In on tho uncorthlvdln with
          the strains of "Hall to the Chief a number of

          Hendricks" wore Just being passed into tho

          of Jhe platform a few minutes tho delegates In
          chargo of tho standards formed themselves Into
          a procession and marched around tho hall,
          while thaband favored tho crowd with "Tho
          Star Spangled Banner."
          Immediately upon tho cossation of tho muslo
          the peopio began again with a second chapter
          or uproar, when tho band came In with
          "Dixie," which was saluted with a delirious
          scream by tho southern members, ably assisted
          by the northern wing of tho democracy. Suc
          ceeding tho Interval of slmplo yolllug which
          succeeded "Dlxlo" camo tho strains of "Auld

          voices thundered tho refrain of tho familiar
          old song.
          Tho audlenco and delegates were perpetrat
          ing the discordant sounds which followed
          "Auld Lang Syne." Tho solemn, notes or
          "Old Hundred" came floating down from the
          gallery In vrhlch tho muslo was located, and
          15.000 voices Joined in tho grand old hymn.

          was at an end.
          Then tho band struck up "Old nuhdrcd,"
          and all Joined in tho solemn hymn of praise.
          This was followed by tho muslo and song,
          "America," and that again by "Homo, Sweet
          Home." Tho sccno vvaa equally grand and
          touching.
          Finally the chairman got a chance to mako
          the formal announcement of the vote. Ho said
          that thero had been 616 votes cast, nil of them
          for Thomas A. Hendricks, and that Mr. Hen

          8CENE3 AND INCIDENTS.
          Graphic Description of tho Stirring Events, of
          Yesterday's Sessions.
          Chicago, III., July 11. Tho.fourth and last
          day of tho national democratlo convention
          opened, as yesterday, with an overflowing
          house. It has been a week from to-day sluco
          delegates arrived in tho city. During that
          tlmo they havo gone through great physical
          labor and mental suspense. Some of thern
          havo not averaged four In twenty-four hours
          sleep, and physically tueyuro about as tired
          out as men cau bo. Thoy, however, came up
          smiling this morning, and, Judging from tho
          enthuslastlo greeting given Mr. Hendricks
          when ho appeared In tho hall, their lung
          power was not exhausted. From tho time
          nf tho adjournment of tho convention,
          at 2 o'clock this morning, up to
          tho time of Us reassembling to-day
          tho nntl-Clovolanditcs had used every eflort
          that a disorganized and rattled class of politi
          cians could ue to concentrate their demora
          lized forces upon somo candidate strong
          enough to hold one-third of the convention
          against Cleveland. Tho namos or new men
          wcro canvassed, and among them Mr. Heu
          drick's. Allofthuso attempts met with dis
          aster. Tho Meld was not strong enough to de
          feat Mr, Cleveland, and It was not managed
          w Ith that kklllaud generalship so necessary to
          success. Cleveland had tho machine as well
          tlireo months ago as ho had to-day. The
          machine Is a great cugltio or power In tho na
          tional convention; that it would triumph to
          day has never been doubled by any ono hero
          who hns closely w ntched tho progrcssol evmts
          nnd carefullv studied tbe" filiation.
          lho Now York governor had tho bulgo frpm
          thu (tart. Ho got a good Mart In tho race, and
          could not be headed. It was understood be
          fore tho balloting commenced that tho name
          nfMr. Ilnmlall would bo withdrawn lrom tbo
          convention, and that lrom thlrty-llvo to lorty
          of the lVnnsylvaulans would go to Cleveland,
          Then thotalK was that tho voles of Marland
          and other wtatoi would be east for Cleveland,
          It v as confidently expected that only ono bal
          lot w ould bo necessary to nominate.

          man asked leave to retire, which was granted.
          At this Junction tho utmost anxiety prevailed
          to know what Pennsylvania vVould do. It was
          confidently expected that It would dlvldo Its
          voto equally ncurccn uioveianu asti lien

          respondent, said ho feared that It was another
          caso of Gartlcld. Garfield nominated Sher
          man, and tho convention nominated Garfield.
          When Pennsylvania returned In tho hall,
          and Its chairman announced 42 votes for Cleve
          land, another stirring scone Occurred, and the
          Cleveland men knowing that this gave them a
          majority of thirty over a majority of the votes
          cast, they wero enthusiastically eangnlno of
          tho result aud cheered llko victors. v hen tho
          roll of the states bad been finished and beforo
          tho result was announced, a dozen of men
          wcro clamoring for recognition from tho chair.
          It was evident that tho convention had not
          been stampeded for Hendricks. The Clovoland
          ranks had stood firm agnlnrt tho flerco and de
          termined assault of tho opposition.

          scats, except perhaps tho reporters. At this
          tlmo a beautiful eagle surmounting an anchor

          ners were placed at Its side.- Then Indiana's
          banner was brought up and the banners of tho
          southern states were placed In a solid mass.
          Hats and fans wcro thrown from the galleries
          and caught up by those on tho floor and sailed
          through tho building. Ladles stripped their
          heads of bonnets and tossed tbem in the air,
          A shower of whlto handkerchiefs floated from
          tho gallery, and every two or t hrco minutes tho

          mado for John Kolly, of Now York.
          In tho call of states Kentucky was abont the
          only stato in tho union that did not tjunblo to
          tho situation, only giving Mr. Cleveland fcur
          votes on tho llual ballot, alter his nomination
          had been made by the almost solid vote oi tho
          convention. The nomination was thon mado
          unanimous, and to Intensify tho excitement
          a Ufc-slzcd oil painting pf Mr. Cleveland,
          handsomely framed, was placed In front of
          the platform, which was tho signal for re-
          nowed and nrolontred cheerlnsr.
          Whon tho rdnventlon assembled to nominate
          a vlco president thore was not near so large a
          crowd present, a great deal of tho lntorest hav
          ing terminated In. the nomination for tho
          Sresldenoy. The surface- talk was that Mo
          ouald or Vilas would' bo tho candidate,
          though somo thought it might be a short horse.
          A boom was being workod up for Hoadly by
          tho Cincinnati Kiupiirer crowd. Tho Now
          York delegation was undecided before tho con
          vention met upon its choice for vloo president.
          Tho delegates informed your correspondent
          that the Indiana delegates did not tako kindly
          tntbn Kiiirffostlon. Thov thouorht thet aa Wis
          consin was a doubtful state this year It Was
          llkoly that Now York woiOd spring its big voto
          for Vilas. If, however, any dlsjioslttorr was
          shown upon the part of tho Indlanfaus they
          wouiu wuuia vote ror mm. inu inuiuumns
          were perfectly Indllrerent as to what tho con.
          wntlnn did. and. while the friends of Col. Vi
          las were caucusing on tho floor In his Interest,
          tho Indlanlans sat silently In their tents.
          After tbo transaction of somo preliminary
          business the convention got down to work. In
          the meantime a resolution Indorsing tho Mor
          rison tariff bill was offered, which at tho samo
          time Indorsed ltandall and tho protectionists.
          Under the rules it was referred to tbo commit
          teo on resolutions to bo reported four years
          hence.
          Thero was not much Interest manifested, al
          though each of the namespresonted was prop
          erly applauded until Senator Wallace, or Penn
          sylvania, nominated Hendricks. Thon thero
          was a wild burst of cheering.
          Mr. Monties, of Indlanai declined for Mr,
          Hendricks, who was in bis toat, looking de
          cidedly nervous. The failure to stampede tho
          convention tn his behalf in tho morning had
          somewhat chagrined him, for ho had believed
          mat tue pian so careiuiiy maturou curing tno
          night would surely succeed. Ho was the only
          available relic of tho "old ttokat," and It was
          confidently expected that lho demonstration
          in his behalf would have nmegtcal effect upon
          tho convention, and, turning tho tldo irom
          Cleveland, nominate Mr. Itundrieka, to com
          pensate him for the alleged fraud of 1876.
          Tho schemo didn't work, and Mr. Hendricks
          was not happy. Ho had been sent to.Chloago
          to nomtuato McDonald artdbe bad performed
          that duty, but had also industriously worked
          up a boom in his own behalf. Ills efforts had
          failed and ho was disgruntled. Ho knew that
          McDonald expected tho second place on tbo
          ticket, and vet he did not want to get left
          again nlmself. So ho hod Mcnzio again say
          that ho would not accept thonomluaton for vice
          president, ho mignt navo maao me acouna
          lion himself, but then the convention
          would havo believed that ho meant It. bo be
          sat silcut and allow ed the enthusiasm to go on
          which culminated when ho .received overy
          vote of tho convention. McDonald's friends
          feci that he has bcon sold out by the ox-governor,
          and It Is predicted that they will sulk
          during tho coming- contest, so that Indiana
          will be carried by the republicans by ut least
          15,000.
          At a conference of tho loading friends of
          Cleveland aud other prominent members of
          the convention, to the,nusaber of about fifty,
          which took placo during the recess this after
          noon, the merits of tho various candidates for
          vlco presidents wore discussed, and it was
          agreed If possible to nominate Thomas A.
          Hendricks for that ofllco. Tho choice nar
          rowed down beforo tho final decision to
          Hendricks and cx-Sonator Henry G. Davis, of
          West Virginia. Mr. Davis was sont for, but
          gavo so so many reasons why ho should not be
          placed upon the ticket and why Mr. Hendricks
          should, that tho latter was at longth decided
          upon. Among the most prominent members
          of tho conference were Messrs. Barnum of
          Connecticut. Clovoland of Now Jersoy, Smith
          M. Weed of Now York, Manning of New York,

          Tho outward trains for tho east were hoavlly
          loaded this afternoon, noarly all the eastern
          marching associations taking their departures.
          The "Americus" and "ltandall" clubs of Phil
          adelphia paraded tho streets before taking
          their lcavo, bearing In addition to their club

          n speelal at 6 o'clock. Somo ot tho members
          took the outcomo Jocularly, but in tho main
          the delegations showed Bitterness or spirit,
          and some of tho marchers dtsplajed bits of

          Albany, t. Y., July 11. Gov. Cleveland was
          at the excouttvo chamber early this morning,
          with Secretary Lamout, attending to business
          as usual. After tho assembling of the conven
          tion tho governor was In receipt of numerous
          dispatches announcing tho progress of proceed
          ings. This afternoon a few personal friends
          were closeted with him. The first intimation
          ho had of his nomination was tho firing of
          cannons by tbe Young Men's Dcmocratlo club.
          Ijitcr ho rccelvod a telegram, and was v Isltcd
          by qulto a number of citizens. Ho has been in
          receipt of numerous telograms from dlllcront
          set tlons of tho country.
          Tills evening tho Jacksoulans and tho Young
          Men's Dcmocratlo club serenaded him at tho
          oxccutlva mansion. As most of tho officials
          nro nt Chicago, his visitors wcro nearly all prl
          vato citizens, hundreds of whom visited him
          during the afternoon.
          Mr. James Tracy, president of tho Young
          Men's Dcmocratlo club, briefly congratulated
          tho governor upon his nomination on behalf of
          bis associates and tho democratic, party.
          Gov. Cloveland responded as follows .
          Fellow Citizi.hs : I cannot but feel gratified
          with this kindly greeting. I find that I am
          fast reaching tho point whqro I shall count
          the pcoplo nf Albany not merely as follow cltt
          sens, but as townsmen nnd neighbors. On
          this occasion I am. of course, aware that
          you pay no compliment to a cltlion. nnd
          prosont no personal tribute, but that
          you have conic to domonstrato your
          loyalty and devotion to a cause In which you
          are heartily enlisted. Tho American peopio
          aro about to oxerciso In Its highest sense their
          powor nnd right of sovereignty. They nro to
          call In review beforo them their public ser
          vants and tho rrpresciitatlvo.of ivolltlcnl par
          ties, and demand or them an account of their
          stewardship. Parties may bo so long In power
          ana may uccoino so arrogant ana careless oi
          tho Interest or tho pcoplo as to grow heedless
          or their responsibility to their masters, but tho
          tlmo comes as certainly as death when tho
          peopio wolgh them In tho balance.
          Tho Issues to bo adjudicated by tho
          nation's groat asslzo aro made up and aro
          about to bo submitted. We bcllevo that the

          lust, aud economical rule, and we bcllevo that
          tho ascendancy of genuine domocratlo princi
          ples will, insure a better government and
          greater happiness and prosperity to all tho
          people. To reach tho sober thought of tho
          nation and to dlslodgo an enemy Intrenched
          behind spoils and patronage, Involves a strug

          result is in this State, and the last bulletin sent
          indicates that the Republican State and National
          tickets are ahead ; but at the rale of Democratic
          gains there seems a chance for the State to go
          Democratic. However, the upper peninsula is
          not nil heard from, and ii is strongly Republi

          preeiucls in Hinds county will give Cleveland a
          small majority. Hancock's majority in Hinds
          county wus 1,881. The Democratic ticket has a
          majority of about 250 in Rankin county, which
          gave Hancock a majority of ivi7. Returns from

          over Paxson (Dem.). The same precincts give
          J. W. Glover (Dem.), tor Congress in the Ninth
          District, 105 majority. If this vote is sustained
          in the other precincts, this city will be Demo
          cratic on the National ticket, Fusion, or unti-
          Bourbon, on the state ticket, and the munici
          pality will be much mixed. A heavy vote was
          polled in the city. There wasmuch scratching
          of the local candidates. The indications point
          to the election of Cram, Democratic candidate
          for Congress, in this (the Seventh) district, over
          Rentfro and Nelson (Reps.). Returns from the

          every Democratic Congressman.

          less excitement anJ interest, andsmailei crowds
          about the lolling places than at the October
          election. At '.'o'clock a heavy cold rain set in
          which had the effect to drive away all idlers,
          leaving only determined workers to watch the
          polls. No disturbance i:< reported anywhere,
          except at one precinct of the Eighth Ward
          where a colored man offered to vote, and, being
          refused on account of non-residence, was
          knocked down aud driven away. There are no
          officers apparent about the polls except the
          regular police. In some places citizens' com
          mittees are present designated by badges. It is
          estimated that the rain will reduce the total
          vote ;ii least a thousand below the October vote.
          Eleven arrests for illegal voting have been made,
          all colored men.

          TiM inn'ati, November 4th. — The quietness of
          the election was broken iv the afternoon al*oul
          1 o'clock i:i the Eighth Ward by a refusal of the
          bystanders at the polls, many of whom were
          armed with clubs, to permit the colored men to
          vote. The voters thus disfrancished went to the
          United States Marsha; for advice, and this gave
          rise to numerous rumors thai the negroes were
          going to organize, and with a force of Deputy
          Marshals marched in a body to cast their votes
          This brought a crowd to the polls, and the ex
          citement was increased by the patrol wagons
          hastening to the scene. The negroes did not or.
          ganize and attempt to vote in a body, and the
          Crowd gradually melted away. -Scon after this,
          at the oilier precincts of the same ward, a well
          known citizen. John I). Cald well, accompanied a
          colored man to the polls to vote. His vote was
          challenged, and the Judges were about to ex
          amine the man under oath, when the bystand
          ers forcibly ejected the colored man from the
          place. The mob pursued, caught and beat him
          until a half dozen or more policemen succeeded
          in extricating the negro from their hands. Soon
          after this a challenged white voter was knocked
          down by the same lawless bystanders. The
          situation at lioth precincts in this ward from
          that time till the polls closed was threatening,
          aud crowds lined the streets in the vicinity ex
          pecting a disturbance. In the Eighteenth
          Ward, in the afternoon, Peter Kelly stabbed
          seriously, it nut fatally, policeman Honeyman,
          on duly at the polls. The provoc.it ion was that
          Honeymau had struck Kelly's" brother earlier in
          the day.

          of tho Republicans. They are confident now of

          Bhouting and otherwise giving vent to their
          hilarious feelings in noisy demonstrations. It
          looks now like a bis Republican victory. The

          11.) Ten
          districts not heretof re reported at all have
          just reached the associated press oflice, some
          of them coming from the mountain regions
          bv mail. Thef-c foot up as follows: Dlaine,
          CtU; Cleveland, 217. N.t Ik-publican )dti
          rality in these districts 4 17.
          A difference of nearly 411 lms been found
          in Cattarnugus county between the asso
          ciated pres footings "and n.turns of the
          county clerk. If the latter's figures stand
          tht-v will increase lllaine's plunuity bv 441.
          If not there will be no change. An effort
          has been made to get tho election of districts
          repeated separately. Tho footing of the dis
          tricts as rocehed at the associated press of
          fice nre correct. The only possibility of er
          ror m in returns having been incorrect at
          first, namely too favorable to Cleveland.
          The situation at three p. in., it this: Several
          errors havo been discovered which, xe-pt
          as to one in 'WWcheater, will very nearly
          balance. The indications ro growing
          stronger that the vote will bo nearer even
          than hy estimates havo conceded. .Many
          counties are vet to be revised however, and
          the work will be slow and tedious. It is
          necessarily so, since in every case where a
          discrepancy is discovered or doubt is raised,
          and the election district returns arc inquired
          for at this late hour, it is not always easy to
          secure these promptly.
          Jay Gould this morning sent the lollow
          ing to Governor Cleveland: "I heartily
          congratulate you on your election. We all
          concede rHew 1 ork. i our Administration
          as governor hus been wise and conservative
          and in the larger field as president, 1 feel
          that you will do still better and tho vast
          business interests of the country will be en
          tirely safe in your hands."
          Sighed: " Jay Goixn.
          1 ji. in. Tho question as to who has car
          ried New York ttate is now chiefly a ques
          tion of thcaccurat-i footings of long columns
          of figures. The footing of county clerks,
          with onlv a few missing, indicate that
          Cleveland has about one thousand plurality
          The footings of election districts made in
          the associated press office, indicate that
          Blaine has nearly an equal plurality.
          Twelve di.-Hcts in the state had not, up "to
          this morning, reported at all. Some sixty
          others had reported, but their accuracy was
          questioned, and they will bo verified to-day.
          The whole list of counties will be carefully
          re-added to-day, and the result of that addi
          tion, as well as the result of the compilation
          of county clerks' figure", will be sent out by
          the associated press. This work will prob
          ably not be completed before night.
          1 Ins morning a salute ol one hundred
          guns was fired in the city hall park by order
          of the leader of the county Democracy in
          honor of (trover CleielandV election to the
          firesidency. The booming of guns drew n
          argo crowd from the bulletin boards at the
          newspaper offices to the park. During tho
          firing a portion of a wad from a gun struck
          a little newsboy named Jacob Simon in the
          face knocking out his rye. The Herald and
          Sun have withdrawn their bulletin boards
          this morning. The crowd was quite enthu
          siastic on the announcement of the election
          of Cleveland and Hendricks, and this
          was increased when it wa declared
          that .lay Gould had conceded the state to
          Cleveland ami had sent a telegraphic dis
          patch to the governor, congratulating
          him upon his election. Tho Republicans
          continue firm however, and still maintain
          that Hlaine has carried the state.
          Tho Mail and Kxpress says neither party
          yields New Yorrf state. Tin- content 13 so
          close that official figures may be necessary
          to determine the result. Returns so far re
          ceived indicate an apparent plurality for
          Blaine.
          The acting superintendent of police to-day
          sent a message to all polico captains to pre
          vent all parades not having proper permits
          from the police, nnd toj give an escort to
          thoso who had permits.
          The l'ost says: "The adherents of G rover
          Cleveland may rest confident that this state
          has given linn" a plurality, and that he has
          a largo majority in tho cfcctoral college."
          A revision of figures in AVcst Chester
          county shows a clerical error in tho associ
          ated prefH footings. The revision of th"n
          error gives Cleveland five hundred more
          votes than tho previous statement based on
          the election districts.
          By orders of the acting superintendent of
          police, issued to-day, tho captains are re
          quired to hold their men in readiness for
          any outbreak that may occur. A large
          force of police officers is massed in the sta
          tion houo nearest to the newspaper offices.
          The supreme court to-dav granted an order
          requiring tho chief of thoWrcau of elections
          to dhow cause, why ho should not ermit a
          committee of lawyers, appointed at last
          night's meeting, to inH-ct tho election re
          turns. Captain Berghold, commanding tho police
          force in the precinct in which is the Wes
          tern Union building, states that everything
          it peaceable
          The complete aseciated press returns by
          election districts from Cattaraugus county
          have been recated by telegraph, and show
          that the county clerk overstated Blaine's
          plurality by 4.12, and that th associated
          press returns lrom that county and footing
          thereof were correct as first published. Tho
          discrepancy, therefore, does not disturb the
          figures originally given.
          The Republican national committee deny
          that Mr. Blaine is coming to New York fo"r
          n conference with them. They say they
          have no means of determining the result in
          tlits state except the election disrrict returns,
          and that they will only take such steps as
          may be necessary to p'rotect the party s in
          terest during the" progress of the count, and
          that to this end counsel will appear before
          tho cdtinty canvassing boards next Tuesday.
          Tho committee say they want nothing but
          fair play and what" the law allows in the de
          termination of the result by those author
          ized to pass upon the returns, and this,jis a
          matter of course, they are bound to insist
          upon.

          To the people of the I'nited States There
          can no longer bo any question concerning
          tho actual result of tlio presidential election.
          Governor Cleveland and Thoma A. Hen
          dricks have a majority of eighteen in the
          electoral -ollege, and it" is not worth while
          for our adversaries to claim tho electoral
          vote of the state of New York. Lt is abso
          lutely certain that the returns of the proper
          officers of tho election on tho night of tho
          lh of November showed a decisive plural
          ity in tho state for the electors supporting
          Cleveland and Hendricks. If any different
          or altered returns are now being prepared,
          or are promulgated, they are corrupt falsifi
          cations of the records of the state of New York
          nd the men aiding or abetting the making
          of tuch reports are criminals, lt is not ex
          pected that you will tamely submit to the
          macWnations'of such men. lA-t them un
          derstand that you will recognize at noon

          actual election of Cleveland and Hendricks
          bv firing national salutes, meet to-morrow
          night throughout tho country and express
          vour opinions in a manner that cannot be
          misunderstood. Tho men of New York are
          resolved not to submit to the gross outrage
          attempted to be perpetrated upon their rights
          and will speak for themselves. Signed

          In Brooklyn late to-night the police
          stopped political parades, fearing they might
          lead to trouble. In this city great crowds
          to-night at the headquarter of the Demo
          cratic and Republican central committees,
          but no returns were given out. There was
          an entire absence of the feverish feeling of
          last night in all parts of the city. The Dem
          ocrats seemingly are content with the procla
          mation that the controversy is ended and
          Cleveland elected.
          Rumors were current late to-night that
          John I. Davenport and John .1. O'lirien had
          been arrested for alleged tampering with the
          election returns. Mr. O'Rricn was"scen later
          and denied that he had been urrtstd. He
          said he understood bo had been indicted by
          the grand jury and he expected to be taken
          into custody in n day or two. Davenport is
          tho United "States commissioner. O'lirien is
          chairman of the Republican county com
          mittee and chief of the bureau of elections.

          Journal concedes the election of Cleveland.
          It savs: There seems to be no longer any
          doubt that Governor Cleveland has been
          elected president. Every county has tent in
          its full returns aftera careful verification 1
          1 ......... (!,....- fi,.,...i.,,,,i .. ,.!.,,-.,i;t,.
          of about one thousand in this state. The
          vote will not vary two hundred 011 either
          side of those figures. New York gives
          Cleveland enough votes to elect him. The
          Journal has devoted all its energy toward
          securing the result and it now reluctantly
          sLutcs that the election has been decided dif
          ferently from its deires. It believes that a
          prompt recognition of the will of the ma
          jority is essential to the maintenance and
          preservation 01 American institutions. o
          lotig a tho people of the United States have
          decided to tran-fer the federal administrie
          tion to the Democratic party, wo are glad
          that n decision has been made in favor of a
          Democrat from New York state.
          Congratulatory dispatches have poured in
          upon tlio governor all morning. They come
          from rverv state in the union. Already
          several thousand have been received.
          Among the telegrams was one from Jay
          Gould, congratulating Governor Cleveland
          on his election. There was a constant
          stream of visitors in and out of the executive
          mansion all morning. .Many ladies were
          among the callers. The governor bore his
          honors modestly.
          The excitement in this city has largely
          subsided, the Republican generally conced
          ing Cleveland's election. Many business and
          private, houses are decorated. The enthu
          siasm among the Democrats is subdued but
          intense. The Jacksonians, one of thu load
          ing campaign club', will serenade President
          elect Cleveland at the executive mansion
          this evening. On Monday night next a
          monster celebration will be held, in which
          all the campaign clubs of Albany and vicin
          ity will participate.

          Wnhington county gives Blaine 7,337;

          The police are guarding the Telegram
          building, which was to-night surrounded by
          a mob of 0,000 or 7.000. Tho Telegram
          bulletin boards were torn down and broken
          into splinters. No more bulletins will be
          put out, by the request of the police. The
          mob was "good naturcd and there is not
          much fear of violence. Two news boys had
          their Telegrams taken away and torn up.
          All the extra police are on duty.
          The police finally dispersed the mob in
          front of the Telegram oflice. The street be
          came comparatively quiet. Little knots of
          men gathered on the corners reading the
          midnight's extra.
          A special from Hoosic Kalis to the Tele
          gram says: Butler tickets there are till count

          Al'OL'sTA, Me. Nov. 7. Mr. Blaine being
          interviewed at his homo said he had treated
          tho Republican nomination as an honorable
          trust confided to him without solicitation
          and had, therefore, spared no time and no
          cllbrt to secmo its success. He had confi
          dence that he had been fairly elected and
          he trusted that every effort wou Idjiow bo
          made to vindicate the ballot. "To quote
          mv own -aying on an important occasion,"
          added Mr. Blaine, "any party in the United
          States can bear to bo defeated, but no party
          can bear to be defrauded." Mr. Blaine
          freely expressed the judgment that a major
          ity of the votes of New York havo been cast
          for tho Republican electoral ticket ho
          thought tho returns and comparisons with
          former votes clearly established this conclu
          sion.
          Latest advices received here from New
          York are to tho eli'ect that the Republican
          coinmitties of tho state and national, after a
          careful examination of tho whole ground art
          satisfied that the state has gono for Blaine
          and Logan. They state that a correct count
          will show a small Republican plurality and
          that thev havo taken steps) to establish the
          fact. Afr. Blaine's re-idence was crowded all
          day, many prominent citizens from disL-int
          part of the state arriving. Interest in the re
          ult in New York is growing deeper every
          hour. This afternoon Blaine talked freely
          about 'his situation. He said to distin-
          gnished citizens of Elaine, "I feel entirely
          satisfied that tho honest votes will change or
          manipulation will show a plurality lor the
          Republican electors of not less tliau 1,500
          votes. I don't speak idly, but from the
          most necurato data carefully furnished tne
          from tho most competent sources." Mr.
          Itlai'ie added that the dispatch of Daniel
          Maniiinj;, published yesterday, contain
          ed tho most arrogant and offensive
          threat t control the election returns
          iu the inteiest of the Democratic
          ticket ever made in any northern state, and
          equaled the worst bulldozing proclamations
          over issued in the south, lie thought its ef
          fect would be to reduce the law abiding cit
          izens of New York who cannot afford to
          have their state reduced to tho level of law
          lessness prevailing in South Carolina and
          Mississippi. The gentleman asked .Mr.
          lSlaine if lie felt much disappointment over
          the po.-sible pro-pect of losing the presiden
          cy by such means. Mr. Blaine answered, I
          don't feel so in any personal sens" but pro
          foundly so on account of the vast national

          great pride that no imputation of fraud has
          ever been seriously uttered against the mem
          bers of the Republican party in any state or
          district. I don't believe the American peo
          ple will accept a fraudulent result. The re
          publicans havo carried tho northern states
          by more than 300,000 majority and they do
          not propose to have the leading state taken
          from them by fraud.

          Republicans.
          The News' returns indicate a tio between
          the parties, with two districts in doubt. The
          Republican state central committee claims n
          majority of one on jnint ballot.

          the Republican partv, should not yield to

          The looting ol the dlatricta aa receive.! in

          only possibility of an error is in the returns
          having been Incorrect at first, namely Ibv.t

          received here from New York are to the
          effect that the Republican Committees, State
          and National, Rlter a careful examination of
          the w hole ground are satisfied thai the State" '[
          has gone for Blame and Logan. They say
          that a correct count will show a Republican
          plurality and that they have taken steps to
          establish the facts. Mr. ltlaiue's residence ,
          was crowded all day. Many prominent citi
          zens from different parts of the State were
          present. The interest In the result in New
          York Is growing deeper every hour
          This afternoon Plain.- talked freely
          about the situation. He said to a dis
          tinguished citizen of Maine, "I feel
          entirely confident that the honest vote of
          New York without change or manipulation
          will show a plurality for the Republic.v
          electors of not less than two votes. Ido not
          speak Idly but from the most accurate d»t i
          carefully furnished me from the most coin
          peleitl sources. Illaltte added that the dis
          patch of Daniel Manning published yester

          sive threat to Control the election returns In
          the interest of the Democratic ticket ever
          made by any Northern State and equalled
          the worst bulldozing proclamations ever
          issued in the South, lie thought its effect
          would be to arouse the law abiding citizen*
          of New York, w hocannot afford to have their
          State reduced to the level of lawlessness
          prevailing in South Carolina and Mlssfssip
          pi. The gentleman asked Maine if befell
          much disappointment over the possible
          prospect of losing the Presidency by such
          means- Mr. Blame answered, "I do not feel
          so in in any personal sense, lint profoundly
          so on account of the vast national interests
          depending upon the result I feel great
          pride that no imputation of fraud has ever
          been seriously uttered against the members
          of the Republican party in any State or dis
          trict. Ido not believe the Americau people
          will accept a fraudulent result. The Re
          publicans have carried the Northern States
          by more than .WO.ooo majority, and they do
          not propose to have the leading state taken
          from them by fraud."

          been busily engaged In receiving and en
          tertaining callers, among whom wore many
          Republicans, personal friends. An Asso

          cians. Senator Yoorhees among them, he
          was In au apparently happy frame of mind,
          expressing himself as satbtied that the Dem
          ocratic candidates had been elected. He
          bad nothing he said, to add to w hat had al
          ready been expressed by him for the past
          day or two respecting the election. The ex
          citement of the last three nights is beginning
          totelion the people, and the crowd on the
          street to-night is much smaller and less
          demonstrative. No hulletlns are displayed
          anywhere, and affairs are beginning to re
          sume their normal condition.

          -New York, November 14th — a. m. — It is
          well known that frauds, if anywhere, were
          committed here in the city. Early on the
          election evening it was given out thai 367
          election districts, which is more than half
          the city, bad given Cleveland 17. "'-' ma- !
          jority. Soon after came the statement that
          Cleveland's majority would not exceed 30,
          --000. After wards, again, but after midnight,
          came another announcement that Cleve
          land's majority, with four districts to hear
          from, would give < 'leveland 12,000 majority,
          Then came the final announcement tbat
          the city complete had given Cleveland 53, |
          000 majority, and was so published in the
          WW  bnl in no other paper. It was after
          wards announced that 53,000 was an error
          for* 43,000 majority. Now,. in view of th
          fact thai 13,000 was sufficient ii' genuine, to
          carry Cleveland through, an extract from
          th.. '.*-'.<!.-, Kelly's organ, tliis morning, is
          significant. Following is the extract:
          ■•The Tammany Hall Committee of Seven,
          on the pari of the Tammany organization,
          to ' watch the canvass of the electoral
          ticket, had a long conference last evening
          with the Chairman of the Democratic Na
          tional and State Committees. The visitois ;
          hail two objects in view. First to positively I
          deny the existence of any deal between '
          Tammany Hall and the Republican Alder
          men, affecting the Presidential contest.
          This assurance was deemed necessary, in
          order to allay a public fear throughout the
          country, which had been worked up by
          the circulation of unfounded newspaper
          rumors, thai Cleveland and Hendricks
          were to be sacrificed for some local ad
          vantage. Ex-Senator Foster, Chairman of
          ; the delegation, satisfied the representatives
          i of both the committees that the Tammany
          I Supervisors would permit no action in the
          : Board which would lose the Democratic
          | Electoral ticket a single vote." It is well
          I known that} -"ii after the polls closed,
          i certainly belore 0 o'clock, some of
          . the biggest Democratic politicians in tlie
          city — one a Congressman elect— telegraphed
          Cleveland at Albany that his election was
          certain, and congratulated htm. The ques
          tion is: did these gentlemen know that the
          city could be relied upon for any amount of
          Democratic majority to elect the ticket .'
          All these statements are [indisputable, and
          ' can be corroborated by proof: and just here
          is where the Republicans based their hopes
          j that the .quarrel between Tammany and
          ' the County Democracy would bring out the
          i truth and tacts.

          New York, Noveniber 13th. The Star,
          regarded- as tbe Tammany organ, says:

          appointed on the part of the Tammany

          evening with the Chairmen of the Demo
          i cratic National and State Committees, ana*
          I positively denied the existence of any deal

          EFFECT OF VNCKRTAIXTY OX-BCBIXESS.
          Xew York, November loth. — C. I. Hun
          tington said in your reporter this afternoon,
          when asked his opinion on the general
          business outlook : *' I think we have left
          the worst behind us, and brighter times are
          ahead. The present condition of business
          is not half so bad as the past."
          ■• What is your opinion of Cleveland ?"'
          Cleveland is a safe man. Of course I
          do not include the party he represents in
          saying this. The Democratic party will
          never be as safe as the Republican, Cleve
          land's election is generally concefed by
          businessmen. At any rale" the feeling of j
          uncertainty as to the result is confined to ■
          but few, and has pot affected business to
          any extent."
          "How will the change in administration
          affect the railroad interests?"
          " Not in the least. As soon as the excite
          ment over the election has completely died
          out, I look for an increase of traffic. It is ■
          not in the power of any one man to steal
          this country, you know."
          A well-known Wall-street broker, for
          merly a Califoniian, said: ''The general
          feeling of uncertainty over the result of the
          election is hurting business. Thereis noth
          ing at all doing in stocks and will not be, in
          my opinion, for some time. I know of
          English merchants who have counter
          manded large orders, upon learning that
          Cleveland was likely to be elected. other
          merchants are restricting their orders pend
          ing the official count. This uncertain elec
          tion, together with the rate war on the
          trunk Lines, will undoubtedly cause a gt-n-j
          eral depression on the whole street. The
          Central Pacific is ;!. ■ only I !alifomia line I
          know ol engaged in a war of rates."
          THE REP_B_ICA_ PASTY IX GOOD CONDITIO!*.
          Ne*.*" Yokk, November 13th.— The. Sikh look
          ing over the political field concludes that
          the Republican party is in better condition
          than before the election. It says the losses
          it has suffered through the withdrawal of
          the Independents, have been made up by
          the accession of Irishmen and workingmen
          *.vbo went over from tbe Democrats in large
          numbers. There never before was 11 party
          which gained at once such a body of earn
          est and valuable material from the very
          bone and sinew of the country, while there
          is no sense in the idea that either of the
          two parties is going to be broken up at
          present. The Republicans are politically
          in much the better condition of the two.
          They are a compact union. There is no
          difference of opinion or of purpose among
          them. The discordant elements have gone
          our, and the army which remains is peer
          less for steadiness, and was disciplined by
          the defeat of last week rather than de
          stroyed by it. Considered merely as po
          litical organization, the Republican party
          is in good lighting order.
          STRENGTH OF THE ISDEPENDEXI .
          Nev,- York, November — The S.m's
          Hartford- special says: The Independent
          organizations, both in Massachusetts and
          Connecticut, have been making efforts since
          the election to find out what their strength
          was. So far the result has not been satis
          factory. Di Massachusetts they say not
          less than 25,000 publicans bolted, almost
          • all voting for Cleveland, some for tot. John !
          ' anil some ii"! at all. In Connecticut the
          energetic wealthy men who forsook busi
          ness am! managed the Independent can
          vass, a-.-r rt that they were supported by not
          less than 5,000 voters, and have cut clean
          out of the Republican party. These esti
          ' mate, are ma simply to gratify curiosity.
          jln Connecticut the Independents will,
          j within a few days, formally decide to hold
          aloof, as a live organization at least,
          ' until future developments in politics shall
          make some other action necessary. The
          idea iras seized them that they are the little
          Ilame by which a great new]. arty of reform
          is to be lighted.
          THE IXDEPENDENT REPCBLICAXB.
          New York November I3th.— The Inde
          . pendent Republican Committee of one hun
          ! dred met to-night in the Brooklyn Academy
          of Music. President Maxwell said the
          I question to be decided was whether the
          organization should be made permanent,
          ii- was in f ivor of this, for the purpose of
          holding the balance of power between the
          parties. Bee her said he was also in favor
          of making the organization permanent.
          In local matters be was a Republican ; in
          national matters a Democrat. He believed
          Cleveland bad been elected by the Inde
          pendents, and every man who helped put
          him in the Presidential chair was bound to
          support hini until he had done something
          to forfeit their support. They should keep
          the organization intact, ready to be sum
          moned at the sound of the trumpet. A
          committee was appointed to devise a plan
          for permanent organization. : - ;- -:

          New York, November I3th.— The World
          this morning, in an editorial on the next
          Senator from New York, says : "Would it '
          not be to the honor of the State and tn the

          could be laid aside and the Legislature be

          The Graphic this afternoon, in an editorial
          vcrv complimentary to Conkling, says:
          Now if Mr. Conkling should be the Demo

          the situation is far from pleasant. It has

          by drunken Democrats. Since these occur
          rences many explanatory letters have been
          received from all the points named, stating
          that the perpetrators of the ruffianism were
          miserable, drunken roughs, and thai their
          acts arc by no means any evidence of a

          commenting on the above state of things,
          says: The Atlanta Constitution and Mem- .

          The remaining seventeen counties will

          Preparing ... Paint the Town Red. —
          Information is at hand, from a gentleman -
          who is a recipient of an invitation to be
          present anti participate, that the citizens of
          Colusa county are making elaborate it pa- _
          rations to '•paint the town of Colusa red"
          on to-morrow evening, the affair being
          occasioned by the supposed victory of the
          Democracy at the late national election.
          The Colusa Democracy have undoubtedly
          read in the old book where David said,
          "Rejoice, and again 1 say rejoice!" But,
          then, it must be remembered that David
          was not exhorting Democrats, nor did be
          advise rejoicing before the official canvass
          was completed. He would have told them
          to wait for the latter before starting out on
          a town-painting expedition. A gentleman
          yesterday, speaking of the proposed dem
          onstration, remarked : " Even i*i the event
          of the election of Mr. Cleveland, which is
          not by any means certain as yet, I would
          advise' our Democratic brethren to in- as
          unostentatious in their rejoicings as pos
          sible, for their success cannot be ascribed to
          their own increase of strength, but to loss
          of Republican strength by reason of the
          Independent and Prohibition vote, If they
          do have occasion to celebrate, I suggest that
          they lie very careful that they do nothing
          to Wing to mind that gory garment, at
          which they always appeared to bic.me as
          frightened when shaken at them by Repub
          licans, as a Spanish bovine at a red hand
          kerchief. So, therefore, I would say to
          them, ' Don't paint the town red, whatever
          you do!*" v^'-.*'

          depot this morning who had arrived
          from Chattanooga Tenn and were on
          their way to Colorado The crowd was
          a promiscuous one in which the fash
          ionably dressed mixed freely with
          those who were clad in clothes which
          were shabby Nearly all the women of
          the party carried babies in their arms
          and numerous other young ones hung
          to their mothers apron strings Elder
          Roberts one of ths party said the rea
          son why the Mormons were changing
          settlement was because Colorado and
          Utah offered more advantages to peo
          ple of their sect The Mormons have
          established a permanent settlement in
          Colorado and no doubt a great number
          of those who belong to that sect will i I
          follow the present emigrants in fact
          from Elder Roberts conversation it
          looked as if there was going to be a

          Here May be Counted by
          the Hundreds'
          Pharmacy Commissioners Will
          Revoke on Specific Complaint
          Claiming Discretionary Power
          i
          PtesMent John A. Leverty of the
          estate Board of Pharmaoy OommiMlon
          ra stated to a. Fumar reporter today
          that th board stands ready to aot
          agalxust th sal of opium, heroin and
          other narvating drags In cases where
          specific ahargu are brought. The
          board takes Jurisdiction upon th
          ground that it has discretionary pow-
          -violated.
          There is no law In this State against
          the sale of morphine or its derivatives
          iu.t the board is of the opinion that
          th pharmacy laws are not intended
          to provide a meani for victims of
          drag habits to purchase drugs with
          .Immunity.
          Concerning the recent case in this
          -c3tjF -where the board took aotlon Pres
          ident leverty stated: "We would not
          have been able to take action If spe
          cific charges had not been made.
          There ie no doubt there are a large
          number of heroin users in Connec
          ticut, but the sellers of the stuff (If
          4T-tifrfiital cannot be Dunished bevond
          the revocation of their pharmacy li
          censes ; until the legislature enacts a
          itatute similar to the oocaina law.
          The crusade being conducted in
          JJfew York against heroin has made
          this state a haven for the users of the
          drug. New Haven has passed an or
          dmanoe against the sale of the stuff
          nd the result is that the users - are
          coming to Bridgeport to purchase.
          "Already there is a substitute for
          heroin on the market. It is called
          dlonln' ethyl morphine hydrochlorate)
          ana the law that does not cover all
          ?i-u mm of a morphine derivative will
          Have little effeot in stamping out the
          ""n" understand that the Bridgeport
          aldermen are to pass an ordinance at
          Its next meeting. If they specify
          heroin alone and do not specify all
          drugs of a morphine derivative they
          will leave loopholes for the users to
          crawl through."
          "Bing" Is the slang name of the
          drug used bv the drug slaves here. It
          Is estimated that there are between
          pno and 400 users of the drug in this
          oity Its line is said to have been
          first introduced here by habitueB of
          mo nnderworid. -who taught the possi
          bilities of producing soothing sensa
          tions to young men and boys they
          mt in lunch rooms and pool and bil
          liard halls. The drug users are now
          -i n h found among factory work
          ers and clerks who carry the stuff
          in the sawea on iuu aa. luuuiam
          Heroin is said to produce a, feeling
          that makes the user feel as though
          he owned the world and its users loose
          their aopetlte for food while their
          craving for tobacco in cigarette form
          increases. Increased doses are needed
          from time to time to satisfy the de
          sires. The stuff is expensive and one
          young man who is employed In a
          n'rf End factory recently went to
          ;Nw Tork and bought $18 worth of
          the stuff, spending nis enure pay mr
          a. week in order to have a supply on
          hand.
          Rarelv a month passes without at
          least one death in this city directly
          traceable to the ravages of the drug
          habit.

          SAY THAT DH. FINK
          PRESCRIBED
          South Rend Physician KGo Be
          fore State Medical Board To
          morrow in a Case for Re
          vocation of License.
          Special io News-Times:
          INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. S. The state
          board of medicad registration and ex
          amination will meet here Tuesday to
          hear evidence against Dr. II. A. Fink,
          a prominent South Bend physician,
          charged with prescribing heroin for
          minors. The action is for a revocation
          of Dr. Fink's license.
          The charge was liled by attorneys
          for 2"sewton Ilolycross, a South Bend
          contractor, who charges the prescrip
          tion was given his son, Raymond, by
          Dr. Fink. The boy is said to have
          purchased the dru -at Paul Wolter's
          drug store in South Bend on the pre
          scription. The charge is iilcd under the act
          passed by the legislature at the last
          session in which heroin was put on
          the "black list" and physicians forbid
          den to prescribe the drug to u-i ir.
          A short time ago, it is charged,
          yonng Ilolycross' parents noticed he
          was acting peculiarly, as if under the
          influence of a drug. After close ques
          tioning the boy is said to have broken
          down and admitted the purchase of
          tho drug through the prescription,
          naming- the physician. The charges
          were prepared immediately and filed
          with the state beard.
          Raymond Ilolycross was one of the
          boys involved in the -drug" expose
          in South Bend last winter when sev
          eral South Bend druggists were ar
          rested charged with furnishing the
          "dope" to minors. The cases were
          dismissed, however, when it was found
          the statute did not cover the particu
          lar drug, heroin, which the boys had
          been taking. They were lirst sup
          plied the drug through an Assyrian,
          Solomon Neimer. it was claimed, who
          acted as a purchasing agent.
          The agitation resulting from this
          expose was the cause of the introduc
          tion of the bill to prohibit the sale
          or prescription of heroin to persons
          known to be users.
          The act provides that a physician
          shall lose his license if convicted of
          prescribing the drug to an habitual
          user. In criminal proceedings a line
          of $ur or not more than 5G00 and im
          prisonment in the county jail not le
          than io days or inr- than a year, is
          provided for the lirst offense. For the
          second offense the line is not less than
          $-j00 or more than 51.00 and im
          prisonment in the penitentiary from
          one to eight years.
          Druggists who sell heroin on pre
          scription must keep a record of such
          sales and report to the state board of
          pharmacy.

          Eleventh and Winter streets station, gave
          him his freedom yesterany. ouuy .., -Klns

          chaffer Is a flaxen-hnlred youth who
          n fairly sturdy In the dayB before ho
          began experimenting with heroin. Ho
          weighed about HO pounds then. Today
          ills weight Is down to 120 and tho clothes
          he wears are sizes too large, though once
          they ntted him. His head hangs weakly
          and he has trouble walking moro than a
          few steps.
          Schaffer has been treated twice for tho
          drug habit. Onco It was In tho House of
          ri i pctlon. where he sreved three month
          nfter stealing from a department store to
          get money for the drugs. A month ngo
          he was discharged as cured from the
          mlladelphla Hospital.
          "But ou can't keep away from It
          .around here," Schaffer explained, as he
          told his stoo. "I kept away from the i
          drugs two weeks nnd then two men Held
          gome heroin before me. I've been pretty
          bad since then."
          His being "pietty bad" resulted In an
          attack of heart failure, which caused his
          arrest. When Patrolman MoKonna, of
          the Eleventh nnd Winter streets Btatlon,
          found that Schafter was not drunk, tho
          boy was sent to tho Hahnemann Hos
          pital and then back to tho police station.
          "J had a close call," said Schaffer. "I
          was filled with heroin and cocalno all day
          and a convulsion got me. That's the way
          they all die," he added, shaking his head.

          surrounds the making of 17-ye.ir-old co
          caine fiends.
          "Hard to get cocaine? Well, I should
          say not'' he exclaimed. "I never had
          any trouble buying all I wanted when I
          had the money. Did they mind selling to
          a boy? They did not. I could show you
          a good many drug stores where you can
          buy It now. But most of It comes from
          the cocaine peddlers.
          "J started taking drugs Just about two
          y fiats ago I used to stay around a pool
          room at Eighth and Vine streets. Tho
          fellows In there asked mo If I didn't want
          to try some heroin. So I did. I took it
          every day for a month and then I thought
          I'd stop. But I couldn't"
          Tho only limes since then that the
          Schaffer boy has lived without drugs have
          been the periods Just following his re
          lease from hospitals.
          "1 worked for some chemists at Eighth
          aiid Callowhlll streets when I first began
          lifllng the stuff," Schaffer went on. "But
          7 couldn't hold on long after the habit
          fcot Yne. I started taking one tablet of
          one-sixth of a grain a day, Saturday I
          took 35 tablets.
          "Of course, I didn't always have money
          to buy heroin. I used to steal things from
          department stores when I needed money.
          Once you get tho habit you can't go more
          than three or four hours without heroin.
          "I used to take little things from the
          counters and I never got caught. But
          Inst march I picked up somo Jewelry and
          they caught mo out on tho lHvnik."
          Schaffer was sentenced to three months I

          are made drug fiends and his own experiences trying to break the habit.

          Schaffer says he has taken heroin for

          Ruimd tfwWidows Sm
          Under an Entirely Novel Interpretation of Law
          the Boy Heroin and Thus Made a Drug Fiem
          Young Leo Rooney, IS HELD TO ACCOUNTAl
          TO THE MOTHER-a Wholesome Lesson
          to Those Who Traffic in Dangerous i
          The Decision of the Court,
          Which Has Established
          (
          a New Principle of
          Judge Howard, Who Has Made a New Interpretation of
          Law, Which Holds a Druggist Accountable lor
          Damages to Parents Where He Injures the
          Earning Ability of a Son by Supplying
          Him with a Habit-Forming Drug
          Opinion of the five Judges of the Appellate Division, writ
          ten by Justice Wesley O. Howard, affirming the verdict
          of the Court awarding $j,ooo to the mother for the dam
          age done in destroying a son's services, to which she was
          legally entitled.
          A MOTHER brings this action against a drug firm for having
          sold to hor -minor son a certain poisonous drug known as
          ?heroin. She alleges that as a jesult of these sales her
          son became an habitual U6er of heroin and thereby became a
          physical and moral wreck, unable to perform any labor and that
          his health -was ruined and his mind destroyed, whereby she was
          deprived of his services and. has been greatly damaged. The
          facts were submitted'to a jury and a Verdict returned in favor
          ?f the plaintiff for $2,000 compensatory damages and $1,000
          punitive damages.
          Our examination of tne records convinces us that the num
          erous sales of this drug to this boy continuing over a long
          period of time have been established by overwhelming evidence.
          And we believe that the evidence shows that the plaintiff was,
          in fact, actually damaged. The proof showB that" previous to his
          acquisition of the drug habit the young man earned considerable
          money.
          The action is said to be a novel one. Tn 'some respects this
          is true. By whatever name this action may go the fact is that
          the property rights of tho plaintiff have been trespassed upon
          and she is simply suing for reimbursement The services of
          her sob. to which she was legally entitled, have been destroyed,
          so she alleges and so the Jury found, and she is only asking pay
          for this damage done.
          The plaintiff bases her claim upon the same principle which
          underlies the cause of action accruing to a father in ca30 of the
          abduction of his daughter, or to a husband in case of the aliena*
          tlon of his wife's affections. Precedent ib not necessary In order
          that the plaintiff may recover here. If tho rights of the plaintiff
          have been Invaded, there must be redresB.
          On one occasion 1,000 pills were Bold to him In a week?
          enough poison to kill many normal people. But notwithstanding
          thi3 condition of affairs, amply proven at the trial, the defendants
          complain of the punitive damages which have been assessed
          againBt them. Unless there is either evil intent on the part of
          the defendant, or a reckless disregard of the right6 of others,
          there can be no punitive damages. The evidence In this case
          does not go to the extent of establishing an evil purpose to de
          stroy the health and activities of this young man; 'but the proof
          does abundantly establish, In our Judgment, that the defendants
          were wholly reckless of the rights of others.
          It establishes that the defendants. Impelled by the ln3tlnct
          for gain and profit, absolutely disregarding the health and future
          of this young man, and wholly unmindful of the consequences to
          his parents, sold him this drug and continued to sell it to him
          long after they discovered Its deleterious effects upon his system.
          To say that they did this innocently affronts the reason. These
          defendants were pharmacists, skilled in the science of mixing
          drugs; they knew their purposes, usee and effects. They knew
          the subtle, sinister destructive effect on the human syBtem of
          Ihis offspring of opium. They knew of its malicious and uncon
          querable mastery over the human mind?knew of its inexorable
          demands upon Its victlmB.
          But it was not necessary to be a pharmacist to know this;
          every layman knows it. However, in the face of this general
          knowledge of the baneful effects of
          heroin, and in the face of their con
          stant dally observation of the actual
          deadly effects upon the victim whom
          they were supplying with it, these de
          iendants, actuated only by greed, con
          tlnued for many months to sell it to thlB young m:
          deluded companions.
          During the time which these defendants were sup
          drug to a young man he "became a vagabond, an id!
          fiend and a criminal; undutiful to his mother, wortfnl
          self and dangerous to the community. The Jury w
          concluding that all this was the result of the Illicit tri
          on by these defendants and that they should be pi
          their reckless disregard of the rights amT welfare <
          and his mother.
          Story of the Ruin of the
          Widow's Son
          IN awarding a mother, a widow, 53,000 damages against
          a druggist who sold to lier son, a minor, quantities
          of heroin during a period of several years, a Su
          preme Court jury sitting in Schenectady, New York, has
          established a precedent making it just as criminal to
          destroy the efficiency of a boy as it would be to injure
          a man's property, his horse' or cow.
          Hitherto persons who sold to young men drugs or
          alcoholic drinks which damaged their health could bo
          prosecuted only on the legal technicalities prohibiting
          the sale of drugs without a prescription or the sale
          of drugs to minors.
          What Is of nation wide interest and significance in
          'the verdict accorded the mother of I?eo Rooney, of
          Schenectady, New York, is that it makes the scoun
          drels who for petty and sordid profit hand out to
          young men poisons that ruin them in body and mind
          legally responsible for the destruction of their moral
          ? ^character and practical efficiency. The verdict of
          the Supreme Court jury, the first of its kind ever ren
          dered, was recently carried before the Appelate Divi
          sion in the fight made by the druggists accused of
          celling "dope" was unanimously upheld.
          In the opinion written by Justice Wesley O. Howard,
          of Troy, In which four other judges concurred, it is
          stated that the evidence produced in this particular
          case proved that the mother of young Rooney had
          been actually damaged. Inasmuch as previous to the
          boy's demoralization through the drug habit he had
          earned considerable money, and that in the deprivation
          of services to which she was legally entitled the prop
          erty rights of the mother had been trespassed upon.
          "The plaintiff bases her claim upon the same prin
          ciple which underlies the cause of action accruing to
          a father In case of the abduction of his daughter, or
          to a husband In case of the alienation of his wife's

          essary in order that the plaintiff may recover here.
          If the rights of the plalntift have been Invaded; there
          must be redress."
          According to this decision any parent whose son is
          sold drugs or alcohol to such a degree that his char
          acter and efficiency are destroyed may take action
          against the olfendcr for the actual damage done.
          ^ Judge Howard and his confrere's decision makes it
          as criminal to undermine a boy's health by selling
          him drugs as it is to administer poison to a neighbor's
          horse.
          Four years ago Loo Rooney. of Schenectady, N. Y.,
          was ar, alert, bright, rosy-cheeked, normal boy. lie
          was industrious, obedient, and of help to his widowed
          mother. He was employed by the General Electric
          Company,.of Schenectady, at a salaiy of $50 a month,
          and was regarded by his superiors as one'of the most
          promising young men in their employ. In addition
          to his salary he often earned from SIO to ?15 a week
          singing at entertainments and in theatres.
          The change that took place i;i this youth within two
          years was as startling and sinister as the transforma
          tion of a Dr. Jt-kyll into a .Mr. Hyde. From a healthy,
          rosy-cheeked boy of eighteen, young Rooney became
          a physical wreck. From a happy-dispositioned boy, al
          ways eager to help his mother and to be of service
          to hit, employers, he dovdoped into a vagabond, a
          retusing to work, stealing whatever he could
          in ordet r; secure the drug. He became physically de
          formed. his character became insolent, ugly,, morose
          and sullen.' Hie health ruined to the degree that he
          was unable to perform any labor, his mind destroyed,
          this boy, in whom a mother once took tender pride,
          has goue alotg a road to ruin leading through the
          Schenectady County Jail, the Albany Penitentiary,
          the Fonda Jail to the Elmlra Reformatory, where ha
          Js at present confined.
          f Week by week, while the degenerative process was
          going on, the druggist accused?C. B. Skinner, of
          C. fe. Skinner & Company, Amsterdam, N. Y.?handed
          out, according to the testimony produced in Court,
          this baleful and deadly poison. Week by week, for
          an insignificant sum of money, for what muBt have
          netted only a meagre, and sorry profit, this boy was
          sold from three hundred to six hundred heroin pills.
          One week, according to the testimony, one thousand
          pills were sold to him?enough to kill, declared Dr.
          B. R. Kirscliberg, city chemist, of Schenectady, one
          hundred normal persons.
          Before his eyes, week by week and month by month,
          this druggist could not fail to see the ghastly effects
          of the poison he -was purveying?the fading of color
          in the boy's cheeks, tho growing sallowne-ss of the
          complexion, the rings deepening under his dull, sullen
          eyes, the palsied tremor of his arms as he reached for
          the drug. He could not have failed to see the villainy
          working?no more than the poisoner who deliberately
          watches his victim, no less than the saloonkeeper who
          sells whiskey to young men day by day over a bar.
          How the Drug Sapped His Health
          and Made His Mind Diseased
          According to Justice Howard, the proof furnished
          abundantly established that the druggists, "impelled
          by the instinct for gain and profit, absolutely disre
          garding tlie health and future of this young man, and
          wholly unmindful of tho consequences to his parents,
          sold him this drug and continued to sell ii to him
          long after they discovered its deleterious effects upon
          his system." For the pills sold the druggist received
          seventy-five cents a hundred. ? On the single sale of
          one thousand pills?enough to kill one hundred per
          sons?they received $7.50.
          Shortly after the theft of a large quantity of raw
          heroin by young Rooney from another drugstore in
          Amsterdam, the boy's cousin, James Murry, was found
          dying in the. .Rooney house from drug poisoning. It
          is believed by local authorities that his death was
          due to an overdose of heroin. In the legal proceedings
          it was brought out that the heroin habit had been
          contracted by a number of other young men ia
          Schenectady. Young Hooney's mother, at present em
          ployed as a clerk in a department store in Schenec
          tady, admitted in court that she had expended her
          entire savings of $2,000 in endeavoring to reform
          her son.
          The story of young Roonoy's downfall can possibly
          be duplicated in many other communities where young
          men are sold drugs by unscrupulous druggists. Leo
          liooney at the age of eighteen possessed much of the
          natural curiosity of youth. When, about four years
          ago, William Slavin, a pal, told him wonderfully pleas
          ant dreams could be obtained by taking a certain
          drug, Rooney was anxious to try it. He Avas given
          several pills and?being totally Ignorant of the hide
          ously destructive effects of this product of opium?
          said he would ,like to get more.
          According to the * testimony furnished in court,
          Rooney was taken by his friend to tho drugstore of
          C. B. Skinner & Co., No. 8 East Main street, Amster
          dam, which Is fifteen miles from Schenectady, and was
          Introduced to C. B. Skinner as being "all right."
          On January 1, 1912, ho made his first purchase of
          heroin tablets, securing two hundred tablets, for
          which he paid $1.50. These tablets were sold to him
          without his presenting a physician's prescription, nor
          was his name entered on the "poison book" in the
          store. After his first purchase the boy, according to
          his declaration, bought plllB regularly almost every
          week up until June 5. 1914, a period of nearly two and
          a half years.
          Month by month the fatal power of the drug took
          hold of him and he became a confirmed user of the
          dope. He sometimes took from six to eight pills an
          hour. His purchases averaged from three hundred to
          six hundred pills a week. Sometimes hiB dally con
          sumption was ae high as seventy-flve to one hundred
          tablets. One week he made the astounding purchase
          of oue thousand tablets. These tablets were all one
          twelfth or one-eighth of a grain each. During the
          proceedings brought by the boy's mother against the
          druggist it was testified that on no occasion did Skin
          ner placo the pills in a bottle bearing a poison label
          as Is required by law.
          C. B. Skinner, the druggist accused, has been a
          pharmacist since 1892. He graduated from the
          University of Buffalo in 1S98. The other member of
          the firm, S. W. Skinner, is in charge of a drug store
          in Illon, N. Y. This concern, accuhed of selling to a
          young boy one thousand heroin tablets in a single
          week for the sum of $7.50, is reported to be worth
          $40,000.
          In November, 1912, the boy declared that Druggist
          Skinner asked him if his mother knew that he was
          using heroin. "Not to my knowledge," he answered.
          Itooney's mother, however, began to observe a change
          in the boy's appearance. Day by day he was afflicted
          by what seemed an increasing sickness. His com
          plexion became sallow, his eyes deep and sunken.
          When walking the streets he would sometimes stop,
          andr leaning against a post, fall into a profound slum
          ber in the daytime. From a hoalthy, athletic, Greet
          young man he began to show signs of a deformity.
          He no longer walked erect, but stooped constantly.
          He became sluggish and indolent;' his temper was
          sullen and irascible.
          The boy had always been industrious. His mother
          had come to Schcnectady from Leadville, Colorado,
          in August, 1903, and sent Leo to school until he was
          sixteen. While attending school he sold newspapers,
          and afterward worked for a while for a clgarmaker.
          He then secured employment with the General Elec
          tric Company at a salary of $50 a month. The boy
          had a voice of extraordinary quality and was in de
          mand at local entertainments. He often earned from
          $10 to $15 a week by singing.
          Until the drug took hold of him he was most solici
          tous about his mother and attended to all the house
          hold chores. His mother was hurt and perplexed when '
          the time came that he refused to carry coal from the
          cellar. One day he had told her that he had given up
          his position. Duriug the day he slept most of the time
          and at nights stayed away. Sometimes he was absent
          from his home for an entire week.
          What an Investigation Showed
          and the Verdict That Resulted
          His distressed mother could not guess what was
          wrong with the boy. His surliness and ill temper hurt
          her. When he began having hallucinations, his mother
          decided that something serious was the matter with
          his health. The boy had delusions that black bugs
          were crawling over him and that the air was full of
          bugs. He skulked about the house, declaring that
          policemen were after him. He saw officers watching
          him from catch basins of sewers. Sometimes at night
          he awoke screaming, declaring that persons intent
          upon harming him were trying to get into his bed
          room through the window.
          In the Pall of 1913 the boy developed hallucinations
          of such a violent character that 'he was sent to tho
          Ellis hospital for treatment. There the physicians
          discovered the cause of his trouble. He was in such
          a serious condition that they did not dare stop the
          administration of heroin, hut began treatment with a
          reduction in doses. In about two weeks the boy
          seemed well on the road to recovery and was soou
          I?Bjj
          C. B. Skinner, the Druggist, Who
          Must Pay Damages to Young
          Rooney's Mother for Debauch

          released as practically cured. The physicians who
          had treated hiru, however, discovered Immediately
          after his discharge that a bottle containing several
          hundred heroin pills was missing.
          About this time Dr. B. R. Klrschberg, city chemist,
          accompanied by the District Attorney, made a can
          vass of the drug stoves in Amsterdam. Complaints
          had been made that drugs were being sold to Schenec
          tady boys and suspicion attached to the druggists in
          the nearby village. They called upon Skinner, among
          other druggists, and cross-questioned him regarding
          the sale of the drug.
          Skinner discreetly admitted that he had sold some
          heroin tablets, but had not done so for a long time.
          According to Leo Rooney's story, told recently In
          court, he went to Skinner shortly after the investiga
          tion made by the District Attorney and the City
          Chemist to purchaso tablets and -was cautioned by
          Skinner not to tell anyone where he was securing the
          drug, as it "might cause trouble."
          Young Rooney was often desperate In his craving
          for the poison. His manner of living had completely
          changed. He became a corner loafer and was ar
          rested on this charge.
          His mother asserted he began stealing In order to
          secure money to buy heroin, that he took rugs and
          carpet9 from the floor of her home, which he sold,
          and that he pawned her silverware and his brother's
          Clothing and even sold his own clothing. He begged
          money from whomever he could. Among the ac
          quaintances of Mrs. Rooney was Attorney James J.
          Barry, of Schenectady, who lator handled her enso
          as counsel and to whom Is due the credit of securing
          the verdict against the druggists.
          Leo went often into Barry's office to beg money.
          Usually he asked for a quarter or half a dollar, mak
          ing various excuses. He wanted to get his laundry, buy
          something to eat, or purchase needed clothing. One
          day he asked Barry for a dollar. Barry had observed
          an amazing change In the boy's appearanco and had
          become suspicious. Barry asked what Leo wanted to
          use the dollar for, and Anally the boy admitted that he
          wanted to get medicine which he purchased In Am
          sterdam. Barry carefully undertook a rigid cross-ex
          amination, and the boy, hard pressed, admitted the na
          ture of the drug of which he had become a- victim*

          By HENRY JAMES BUXTON
          When the Coroner of Philadelphia looked
          Into the facts attending the death ot a
          youth named Tony riova, less than a week
          ago, ha was led to exclaim that if no other
          remedy for the cancer called 'The Arsenal
          could be found It should be burned down.
          From Uie little Tenth street pie shop, two
          or threV blocks north of Market, the boy
          had been carried suffering from the effects
          of heroin. He died In a hospital a few
          hours later.
          A special policeman calmly observed at
          the Inquest that "dope parties" were fre
          quently held. In "The Arsenal" and that in
          a recent raid twenty-nine persons were re
          moved from tho place, all but two under
          the influence of narcotic drugs.
          ' In cases like these the hand ot the "dope
          syndicate" la clearly seen. Through an
          .Intricate smuggling system It Imports Into
          this city many 'rmndrod pounds of mor
          phine, cocaine and heroin monthly and dis
          tributes them through Tenderloin agents
          and even from autos that pass through
          various sections on schedule time: This syn
          dicate was facing extinction under the Har
          rison act, which forbids the sale of "dope"
          'except on a -physician's prescription. It
          gained a new lease qf life through the re-
          .cent' decision, invalidating 'section 8 ,of.C&
          act. for this, prevents the conviction, of those
          found with the drug In their possession,.
          declaring that the mere possession of largs
          quantities of a drug is not evidence pre
          sumptive of guilt. -
          HOW 120 "FIENDS" GOT DRUGS
          Legislation is required to stop this enor
          mous leak In the wall raised against the
          flood ot evil sustenance for crime and
          degradation. But tt-'moro difficult problem
          presents Itself In the evading of the law
          by unscrupulous physicians.
          ' Dr. Frank M. Hendrlck, a negro physi
          cian, of 1912 Dickinson street, was arrested
          qn' A'ugust 8 by Deputy Internal Revenue
          Collector McDevltt, accused of supplying
          120 young "dope fiends" of South Phila
          delphia with heroin, the most vicious of
          modern habit-forming drugs. McDevltt and
          Glovanl, a detective In the employ of ths
          State Pharmaceutical Department, testified
          that Doctor Hendrlck wrote heroin pre
          scrlptlons for tha drug addicts under ths
          pretense that, he was attempting to curs
          them by the ''reduction method."
          During seventy-eight days Hendrlck
          wrote 1000 such prescriptions, and tor each,
          one he obtained a tee of $1, making a total
          of 11000 In a little more than two months.
          The prescriptions were filled by two drug
          gists, Samuel H. Toplan and Solomon Bay
          llnson. These two druggists were also
          placed under arrest, accused of having
          made illicit sales to drug victims.
          Tbplan and Bayllnson received 81 each
          for the prescriptions tor heroin filled by

          fied that the addicts who patronized Doctor
          Hendrlck and the druggists ranged in ag
          from sixteen to twenty-Ova years. One of
          them was an eighteen-year-old boy, a high
          school graduate, who was employed In ths
          plant ot tbe Remington Arms Company at
          116.60 a week. This boy waa giving $14 of'

          and the two druggists to fe "cured" of the
          heroin habit.

          HETHER prohibition will or will
          not result in a great increase
          in th'e use of habit forming
          drugs i*? a question on which
          even the experts in drug traffic do not agree.
          One of the arguments of thos*e who believe
          j' will not is that one of the causes of
          drug using is the relief which it affords to
          persons sutTering from the effects of over
          ?ndu.Kt-nce in alcohol. While the experts
          are debating the outcome the public gener?
          ally realizes, in an indifferent way, that
          ilruj; ad'licts are increasing alarmingly every
          .'?car. It does not, however, realize that
          ??'.'.? York state now lias a new "Narcotic
          ch went into effect. March 1,
          and which most experts believe will cope
          with the evil, present and future, better
          than any statute heretofore enacted iri any
          - of the Union.
          Under this new law the Department of
          Xarcotic Drug Control, headed by Com?
          missioner Frank Richardson at Albany, di?
          vides the state into four administration dis?
          tricts. All persons or corporations hand
          ling cocaine or opium or their derivatives
          must register with this board. The manu?
          facturers and wholesalers, down through
          the druggists and physicians, must file one
          of triplicate order blanks, giving dates and
          ?g the amount of drugs purchased,
          prescribed or ?licensed by them. Even den
          ' and hospitals are included in the law.
          Violation of the law is a miiukmeanor and
          of th'- penalties i:; the revocation of

          The Federa! Harri on law and the original
          Boytan state lav/, enacted in 19! 1, although
          ded to curb the evil, had the unex
          ?! effect of causing physician i to fight

          was 'hat the traffic was drrven into the.

          military cantonments themselves.
          It Hinges on
          The Physician
          For the past two years the problem of
          drug control has centred on the physi?
          cians. Justice Cornelius F. Collins, of Spe?
          cial Sessions, chairman of the consolidated
          committee on the drug evil, however, is
          authority for the statement that not more
          than 100 physicians, out of several thou
          i sand in greater New York, have been "un?
          conscionable" violators of the law.
          Th? details of how the new law enables
          the Department of Narcotic Drug Control
          to keep tabs on a given quantity of opium,
          morphine, cocaine or heroin as it passes
          from manufacturer to the ultimate con?
          sumer are too many and devious for the
          purposes of this article. The supporters
          of the bill admit that under existing condi?
          tions of imperfect national and interna?
          tional control it is at best imperfect, but
          they believe that it is a forward step in
          the solution of the difficulty.
          Dr. James A. Hamilton, Commissioner of
          Correction, says the new law will not pre?
          vent physicians from issuing several pre?
          scriptions to the same addict or patient in
          one day. Supporters of the bill point out
          that the Department of Drug Control un?
          der the law has means at hand to discover
          that abuse, and when discovered it, is ex?
          tremely likely that the offending physician
          will lose his license to obtain the drug.
          Ore of the grounds for anticipating a
          f great increase in drug addicts is the war.
          | Morphine and, in many cases, heroin have
          ] been largely used in surgical cases where
          soldiers have been gassed. It is feared that
          I sufficient quantities have been absorbed in
          i this manner to form habits among many of
          ! the returning troops. The War Department
          is trying to guard against this by careful
          medical examination at discharge of troops,
          and embryo addicts will be treated in gov?
          ernment hospitals.
          The Number
          Of Addicts
          The number of addicts in New York City
          has been conservatively estimated by Jus?
          tice Collins at 1 per cent of the population,
          or about 100,000. Causes of acquired habits
          are mainly these: Extensive surgical treat
          ! ment, protracted medication for bodily ail?
          ments and disease, persistent taking of
          patent medicines containing an appreciable
          quantity of the drug, seceking relief from
          alcoholic excesses, to association, environ?
          ment, gang influence and foolish curiosity,
          ! and last, but not least, to the interchange
          of the drug in jails and prisons, where it is
          i indulged in furiously by felons in a frenzied
          attempt to overcome mental anguish.
          The addicts are found in all walks of life,
          the rich and the poor; all professions and
          business callings. The use of the drug by
          the "underworld" and criminal classes ren?
          ders more sinister their power and greatly
          I hampers their chances for reform.
          Opium using and morphine taking seem
          to be waning. Cocaine, and particularly
          ! heroin, are most, in demand. The hero
          ' in habit is growing at an appalling rate
          ' and strikes particularly at the youth of
          1 America. Between the ages of seventeen
          - and twenty-two there are so many heroin
          i users that the average age of its victims
          is easily set at twenty years.
          What the
          Courts Know
          "We men of the courts," says Justice Col
          I lins, "know the horrible examples. We see
          young men almost destroyed, absolute shad
          j ows of their former selves, with will, mem
          , cry and understanding impaired, 'the pale
          I youth* descrioed by Edwin Markham in
          j frenzied fancy, their 'phantoms that fling
          ! wild laughter and wild tears into the crater
          of the wasted years,' with no normal sense
          : of right or wrong, with a pronounced in
          ITHIN a few weeks Paris has wit?
          nessed two sensational trials for
          acts of political terrorism. In
          the one case Cottin, the crazy
          young Kiiarchist who attempted to kill
          Clemenceau, the "grand young man" of
          France, was sentenced to death by court
          martial. In the other Raoul Villain, the
          ? !;?\<r of .lean Jaur?s, leader of French So?
          cialists and anti-militarists, was acquitted
          by a jury after a trial which lasted only
          five ?lay-.
          The acquittal of Villain leads us back into
          the last days of July, 1914, when humanity
          watched in breathless suspense for the fall
          of the blow destined to ?'bake the whole
          world m it-' foundations. Nothing shows
          more clearly the terrible tension of those
          days than the fact, teslitie? to by contem?
          porary newspapers, that the assassination of
          Jaur?s, in ordinary times a firnt rate world
          en ation, was panned over almost unnoticed.
          It. was completely overshadowed by the new?
          of ultimatums, dvclaratioua of war and gi
          W
          gantic army moves, which were just usher- f
          ing in the greatest war of history.
          It was on the evening of July 81, 1914 -
          the last evening of peace that Jean Jaur?s,
          most powerful anti-militarist agitator in
          Europe and leader of trie French Unified
          Socialists, then just triumphantly emerging :
          from a hot election light, was shot by a
          youngish man as he was dining with a frii n i
          behind a window at the caf? du Croissant,
          near the Bourse.
          The assassin, standing on the sidewalk,
          fired several shots through the window-, two
          of which hit the victim, who expired in a
          few minutes. A crow?! seized the assailant,
          who was first believed to be an Austrian,
          and nearly lynched him before he was res?
          cued by the police. He gave his namo as
          Raoul Villain and said Tie was the son of
          a court clerk in Rheims. He admitted that
          before shooting the Socialist leader he had
          first telephoned to the restaurant to make
          sure whether he was there.
          When examined by the magistrate, Villain
          snid that he acted of his own accord and
          did not belong to any organization, reaction?
          ary or otherwise. He Raid:
          "If I have commute?, this net, it is because
          Jaur?s betrayed my country by leading the
          campaign against the throe-year militar;,'
          service bill. I believe one must punish trai?
          tors, and if I give up my life in such a cause
          I shall feel my duty is accomplished." He
          said his mother had been in an insane asy?
          lum for twenty years, which confirmed the
          suspicion on the part of the police that he
          was mentally unbalanced.
          Only on the preceding Tuesday (the mur
          der occurred on Saturday) Jaur?s headed
          a (lepufiition of Socialist members of the
          Chamber, nho protested to M. Bienvenu
          Martin, the acting premier in the absence of
          Vivianj, against France participating in the
          Aust ro- Serbian imbroglio or taking any stej:
          for the recovery of Alsace and Lorraine
          from Germany, after more than forty years
          of peace. Since the breaking of the wai
          cloud he had been working night and da*,
          to make war impossible, and had night!)
          braved the anger i f war-excited mobs win
          yelled in the streets after him, callinf
          him "Traitor!" and "Prussian!" an cpithc
          which in a Frenchman's mouth just thei
          and since meant something worse thai
          traitor.
          It was not the first timo Jaur?s bai
          braved the anger of the nation in the sam
          cause. When the bill to increase the terr
          of compulsory military service from two t
          throe yeui'B first came up, in March, 101?
          ? Jaur?s's opposition to what he called "crim
          ? inal folly" led to violent scenes in the
          ! Chamber and the streets. Advocates of the
          ? measure denounced the Socialist deputies
          as a band of scoundrels and the public in
          ? the galleries joined in the ?lemonstration,
          ! crying 'Down with the traitors!" "Down
          i with the Prussians!" and "Why don't you
          ! go to the Reichstag?"
          This last taunt, uttered in the heat, of
          patriotic, passion, might, in quieter times,
          ; have recalled the fact that Jaur?s once
          tried to go to Berlin, but was prevented
          from doing so by the German government.
          , !t was in July, 1905, just nine years before
          ? his death, that Jaur?s was scheduled to
          . speak before a Socialist meeting in the
          i German capital, His appearance there,
          i however, was forbidden by Prince Biilow,
          tln-n Imperial Chancellor. This in spue of
          ' the fact that it was Jaur?s who only shortly
          before ha?! marshalled tin opposition which
          forced out M. Delcass? from the French
          Foreign Office for what Jaur?s denounced
          j as a chauvinistic and imperialistic policy
          ! boiiinl t?> bring about a European con?
          flagration. For the moment Delcaas?'a re
          ! Lin-merit seemed to benefit the German gov
          j eminent; however, Biilow diaoerned that
          [ Jaur?s's policy, if adopted by tho German
          i Socialists, might thwart imperialistic plans
          nearer home.
          After spending fifty-six months in jail
          ? pending trial Kaoul Villain, Jaur?s's slay
          ; er, was brought before a jury on Monday
          March 24, 1919. Witnesses testified that
          Jaur?s, while opposed to regaining Alsace
          i Lorraine by force of arms, was in favor ol
          a peaceful reunion. Pierre Renaudel, whi
          succeeded Jaur?s in the leadership of th<
          Socialists, said that Jaur?s had decided t<
          make a personal appeal to President Wilsoi
          on August 2, 1914, in an endeavor to havi
          the President intervene and avert wai
          Witnesses for the defance depicted Villaii
          as thoroughly sincere, but ultra-sensitive
          lacking in will power and given to despon
          dency. Men like Ribot, Viviani and Pain
          lev?, former premiers, and Generals Re
          gnault and Sarrnil testified to the lovait
          and patriotism of Jaur?s. The judge advc
          cate declared that he? did not ask for th
          death penalty, but only for a prison scr
          tenet*.
          The verdict, was for acquittal, and thu
          before the law of France the slayer <
          Jaur?s will be regarded on having paid i
          full for his deed with the lifty-nix montll

          clination to embrace the wrong, even though
          contrary to the nature of the youth."
          Justice Collins's experience ?a Special
          Sessions shows that the heroin habit is the
          most quickly acquired, and is now recruit?
          ing the largest share of addicts. Vet heroin
          was unknown until a few years ago, and on
          its introduction it was claimed to be a non
          habit formi.ig drug. Many medical men have
          declared that its manufacture could be dis?
          continued entirely without injury to their
          practice.
          All drug control experts recognize the
          necessity of treatment of addicts by gradual
          withdrawal. There, is, however, no known
          specific remedy for the cure of drug addic?
          tion. In fact, the whole tr
          ?s at seh on the subject, so much so, that
          Health Commissioner Dr. Royal S. Cope
          land has just announced that the Health
          Department of New York will conduct a re?
          search into the subject among the patients
          on North Brother Island. The cocaine user
          is the more susceptible to treatment.
          Perils After
          A Cure
          Temporary cure of all narcotic addict? is
          not so difficult. It is the exercise of the
          free will of the patient after he is dis?
          charged that cannot be. controlled. A period
          of convalescence and recupera: ion is abso?
          lutely necessary. Plenty of fresh air an?
          proper physical exercise while the patient
          is under careful surveillance are most df
          " sirable. The Warwick and Harts Island
          farms are to be thrown open soon for tin?
          purpose.
          It is generally agreed that no permanent
          ' or adequate relief from the growing druf
          i evil will be had until tne attempt ?i 'V'rt
          ! national control, interrupted by the war in
          1914, is resumed. Conditions in the Phil
          ; ippines in 1909 compelled the United States
          i to take the initiative in this international
          consideration of the evil. -Shutting off ?'

          DRUG EVIL IN OGDEN AND
          ELSEWHERE.
          'Tl
          .01
          One must accept with mental reservation the statements on the
          use of narcotics which are being circulated in press dispatches from
          III! New York.
          The Standard has a budget of "news" from the bureau of the New
          York World, in which this paragraph appears:
          A dispatch dated April 21, from Washington, D. C,
          states that federal officials will urge our reprcsentati cs
          at the peace conference to endeavor to secure an interna
          tional arrangement for the enforcement of anti-narcotic
          laws, this action being, in their opinion, demanded by the
          increased use of narcotic drugs in the United States and
          the difficulty expeiienced in controlling their distribution.
          The dispatch also states that the people of the United
          States use five times as much narcotic drugs per capita as
          do the people of China, and it is feared that, with the ad
          vent of prohibition, the number of drug addicts will greatly
          increase unless the most rigid measures are taken to sup
          press the traffic. In this connection, Daniel C. Roper, com
          'L missioner of revenue, in his annual report says, "Compre
          hensive and effective administration of the narcotic laws
          must be based upon an international pcrspectie, support
          ed by international agreements, and co-operative interpre-
          tion or policy under which the drug world trade may be
          adequately policed." Secretary of the Treasury Glass, of
          whose department the internal revenue bureau forms a
          part, will forward a statement regarding this matter to the
          president within the next few days. The report of Repre
          sentative Henry T. Rainey, chairman of the committee to
          investigate the use of drugs in the United States, has been
          ready for sometime but the figures contained in it are so
          alarming that it has been held up by the treasury depart
          ment officials for the purpose of careful verification be
          i fore it is published. The report shows more than 1,500.
          000 narcotic drug addicts in the United Stales, of which
          number New York City is said to have nearly 300,000.
          It may be true that this country has more users of narcotic drugs
          than any other country, but that weakness has developed over a long
          Ij period of years during which whiskey has been openly sold in nine
          Jmi! tenths of the states in very large quantities, and may we not make
          wl'1 the deduction that whiskey has paved the way for drugs?
          These "drug" stories arc being circulated as a defense of whiskey.
          They may prove to be boomerangs.
          For years the American people have been trained to resort to
          drugs. But it is our opinion that the cocaine, morphine and opium
          habits have decreased since those drugs have been legislated against
          by the federal government.
          Ogden, up to six years ago, had shivering, shaking men and women
          f who. in their nervous twitching! as they went about the streets, dis
          closed they were victims of strong drugs. Our jails always had one
          H or more of the unfortunates. Of late there has been no outward evi
          dence of this debasement, and. if Ogden is not the exception, we are
          justified in saying that the drug evil is rapidly decreasing in the Unit-
          jl'i ed States.

          misoner Carleton Simon. With their feet

          ames red from the glow of the open fire-box,
          the stood and watched more than three
          million and, a half dollars' worth of for

          coals. 0

          as derivatives of opium made up most of
          that valuable but contraband collection. It
          represented a little less than a year's accu
          mulation of the Narcotic Division of the
          New York police force under the command
          of'Special Deputy Commissioner Simon.
          It the detectives were able to find and
          confiscate such a quantity of dope in a
          year's time it must, of course, represent
          but a small percentage of the actual amount
          of forbidden drugs which are brought into
          Ne.w York City and consumed in a twelve
          uonth. It was a startling evidence of the
          widespread use of drugs. and the impres
          sive spectacle sobered the faces of Com
          missioner Enright and his deputy. and de
          termined them to. pursue the wicked traffic
          with even greater vigor.
          In addition to the assortment of raw
          opium, prepared opium, morphine, heroin
          cocaine and other contraband drugs there
          was an extraordinary assortment of opium
          pipes and "hop layouts," hypodermic need
          lea and other things used by drug ad
          licts. All these were thrown into the fire
          box of the furnace
          "Well, it is hard to estimate the real
          value to the community of what we have
          destroye4 here to-day.' said Commissioner
          Simon as he tossed the last package of
          drugs Into the furnace. "Not all drug ad
          dicts are criminals, but most criminals are
          drug addicts. We have destroyed enough
          drugs to-day to put half of Greater New
          York to sleep. No one can say how many
          drug-crased criminals and crimes of crafti
          ness and violence have been averted by
          the seisure and destruction of all this
          stuff."
          It is the drug that inspires the crafty
          schemes in the minds of highwaymen, bur
          glars, confidence men and murderers, and
          gives them the courage to do their des
          perate work. A group of criminals, ,for
          instance, will "lie up" for the night in
          some hidden den, smoking opium. Out of
          the fumes will come an idea for swindling
          a rich and innocent widow, perhape, or a
          plan for holding up a paymaster or blow
          ing a safe.
          Then the schemers sleep, dreaming
          weird, exotic, blissful dreams, through the
          thick murky haze, and in the morning at
          least one of the hand will remember the
          brilliant idea of the night before.
          The idea still seems feasible-but it re
          quires courage'-rat like courage-to carry
          it out. Normal men-even criminals not
          under the influence of drugs-would lack
          the nerve to commit the crime. But the
          "hop-heads" do not give up; they know
          how they can get the nerve. A jab of the
          hypodermnic needle, a sniff of cocaine or
          heroin-and they are stemulated, madly,
          unreasoningly, to the point where nothing
          /oan stop them.
          UUnder the influence of the 'Irugs petty

          son them. Drugs not only stimulate crime,
          but Intensify it. And the drug evil is
          growing, as the police know. Specific lo
          calities may nt realize it, but throughout
          the country officers of the law are coming
          to recognise the drug traffic as one of the
          main roots of the evils with which they a
          constantly contend.
          Drugs make criminals in more than one
          way. Not only does the use of drugs tend
          to 'destroy the mental resistance to evil
          that is called morals, but drugs seem to
          make their victihna insensible to the differ
          ence between right and wrong. Drugs
          now cost so much money that the addict
          is usually compelled to resort to crime in
          order to buy them. Many a criminal has
          committed his first offense in order to
          buy his "dope.' 'Commissioner Simon
          says that the average drug fiend pays $5
          a day. $35 a week for his supply. He has
          arrested addicts who confessed to paying
          as high as $16 a day.
          in the sixteen months that Dr. Simon
          has been in offii4 his Narcotic Division has
          made about 4,000 arrests. The record for
          this year is well ahead of that for a corres
          ponding period last year'which does not
          mean that the drug evil is increasing out
          of all bounds in New York City, but mere.
          ly that the Narcotic Division is increasing.
          ly efficient in keeping pace.
          Under the State law anyone caught with
          drugs illegally in his possession may be
          arrested and sent to take "the cure"-a
          scientific treatment administered in a
          State institution, where the patient is
          given diminishing doses of his drug, fed
          according to prescribed dietary, and made
          to exercise until eventually he has lost the
          "habit" and is well ad strong enough
          mentally and physiaally to be released.

          of drug usern that Dr. Simon's men get to
          the drug peddlers-the men they are really
          after. The drug addict tells the police
          where he buys his supply, or they shadow
          him until they find out for themselves.
          Then, pretending to be drug fiends them
          selves-every detective in the Narcotic
          Division can give an excellent imitation of
          a "cokey" or a "hop-head"-they persuade
          the peddler to sell them the drug. Then
          he is arrested, or his depot raided. It was
          the spoils of these raids that went into
          the furnace--except for several thousand
          dollars' worth still awaiting use as evi
          dence in court.
          Where does all this drug come from?
          The Federal law forbid, its importation
          except under bond. The Treasury Depart
          ment has a force of men at work to pre
          vent it being smuggled in-too small a
          force to cover the lengthy borders and sea
          coast of the country. Much of it comes
          from E~urope. Dr. Simon. who has agents
          in England and the Continent, discovered
          'recently that the Germans were manufact
          uring heroin and cocaine synthetically,
          and that they and a Japanese syndicate
          were planning to flood the United States
          with their products. There is no law in
          Germany or Japan to forbid the exporta
          tion of narcotics.
          A good deal of dope has found its way
          to New York recently from Canada, which
          in turn got it from Mezico. By the
          arrest in New York a few weeks ago of a
          Montreal criminal and opium user Dr.
          Simon verined informaion comhag to him
          from other sources, namely, that the drug
          ring in Montreal has been using chorus
          girls playing in Montreal to smuggle drugs
          over the ,order.

          to lure the girls to a certain no

          be a theatrical club, and by
          slipping a drug into their drinks
          ebsiaved them. They craved
          the drug, after they had been
          told what It was that made
          their drink so "different," and
          they could only get the drug by
          4ping the will of the gang. Some
          of them were set to work trying
          to corrupt customs officers.
          others carried supplies of the "Decks
          drug boldly away with them the Fl
          when their shows left town.
          Still others became regular travelling
          saleswomen, making the triangular trip
          between Montreal, Boston and New York.
          The drug wasn concealed in Ingenious ways.
          The mysterious deaths of several beau
          titel girls In New York recently binge
          upon the operations of the Montreal drug
          ring, as did the wild flight of an unnamed
          woman from Montreal to New York In a
          taxi not so long ago-a adventure that
          remains a mystery to far.
          The drug evil has developed a new derm
          of criminal, which Dr. Simon ha. isolaied
          and Identified just as a bacteriologist
          might Isolate and describe a new germ.

          He is the missIonary, the advance agent
          of the drug ring.
          Sometimes he distributes free samples,
          sometimes he enslaves a number of girls
          and spreads the habit through them all
          over a factory or store. He and his assist
          ants work on a commission basis. He is
          the successor to the cadet or 'procurer of
          the whitesiave traficl, for he finds he can
          use girls more profitably in peddling drugs
          than In other florms of vice. Recently Dr.

          clutches of the police, because there is
          emough mosey available to buy the drug
          without resorting to crime. In the last
          few weeks, however, CommissIoner 8imon
          has ten down some of the peddlers who
          supply the upper West, Side, the Murray

          at six every morning he made his seuads
          of famissmable aparment houses, leaving
          three decks of cocaine here, a phial of
          morphine there, half a deon decks of
          heroin at the nelt place. Sometimes, his
          books showed, he was called on to supply
          additional opium or heroin for a "perty,"

          The tenseness of modern life, the after
          war reactiomn-thess,and many other fae
          tors are responsible for the increase in
          the drug evil, and it takes steadf. patient
          work on (ommissioner Simon's part to
          combat it. He himself works with his
          men almost every night, sometimes until
          daylight, watching suspects, raiding drug
          depots or opium dens, questioning prison
          erp.
          The doctor is .a good example of Com
          missioner Enright's policy of placing com
          petent civilians in the Police Department.
          For many years Dr. Simon was well
          known as an alienist and criminologist.
          He figured as an expert n the Burts.
          Guldensuppe, Morrison and Molineaux
          marder trials, and when the murderer
          Tapley was hanged in Jersey City some
          years ago Dr. Simon received the signals
          which, by prearrangement, the murderer
          sent until he lost consciousness. The re
          su1ts of this experiment did much to
          abolish that form of capital punishment in
          New Jersey.
          It was Dr. Simon who conducted the
          principal investigation into the "water
          cure" which the army was accused of
          practising in the Philippines, and who
          made psycholbgical studies of Csolgosa.
          President McKinley's assassin. A few
          weeks ago the Federal Government sub
          poenaed him to act as expert witness at
          the trial in Oklahoma City of the man
          who gave a hashish cigarette to a police
          officer, putting the policeman to sleep and
          allowing prisoners to escape. Dr. Simon's
          testimony corroborated other evidence and
          four men were convicted.
          One of the greatest forward steps in the
          war on drugs is the founding by Dr.
          Simon of a central clearing house for the
          photographs and records of drug users and
          peddlers. He is in correspondence with
          the police authorities in more than 300
          cities here and in Europe, and exchanges
          with them the dossiers of anyone found
          to be engaged in the drug traffic. A few
          days ago Dr. Simon's men arrested a Los
          Angeles addict who had been in New York
          only eight hours.
          And along about five o'clock the other
          morning the Montreal "hop head" referred
          to above was talking to the quiet, kindly
          voiced man who seemed to have something
          to do with the detectives who had made
          the arrest, and yet was not likce them.
          "Well," said the "hup bead," "I haven't
          been able to do a thing since I landed
          here six weeks ago, Haven't made a cent.
          Ad I heAr this guy Simon is a tough egg
          --you caa't get to him, add his men have
          driven moat of the gang out of towny
          that's why there's so many of them in
          Canada now, and why Junk costs sq much
          igore In New York than other places. It's
          hard to get, and this guy Simon Is making
          it harder all the time."
          It was "this guy Simon" to whom the j
          "hop head" was speaking, but he never
          krnew It

          Mr. Kipling’s books have a much
          larger sale in this country than in
          England. In the United States about
          12.').000 copies of “The Jungle Book”
          have been sold, and S0.0O0 copies of
          “The Second Jungle Book.” The aver
          age yearly sale is more than 5,000
          copies of the first book and 2,500 of the
          second, although the first book was
          issued fourteen years ago. The “Thin
          Paper Edition” of Mr. Kipling’s
          works, which includes “Plain Tales
          from the Hills,” about as good a vol
          ume as a man or woman of taste can
          take for holiday reading if he or she
          desires at once to bo rested and
          amused, is meeting with the success it
          merits. Those stories which have
          been translated into French are sell
          ing in greater numbers than any of
          the author's other works except “The
          Jungle Book.”
